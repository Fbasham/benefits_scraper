However, an application for the surviving child's benefit must be made for children under the age of 18.\nAbsences from school\nYou must notify Service Canada should you interrupt, terminate or reduce your attendance at school or university. Please notify Service Canada when you have any absences to determine what may be required to continue receiving your benefits.\nNote: Make sure to document the duration and reasons for absences during your current or past academic year on the Declaration of Attendance at School or University (ISP1401).\nFor extended absence periods, you will require an illness certificate (ISP-1403).\nCircumstances where absences would require an illness certificate\nAbsences that occur during the school year\nIllness certificates can cover temporary breaks in attendance, starting after the beginning of the school year and ending before its scheduled completion.

You will get it automatically.\nNote:\nA child is eligible for the DTC when a medical practitioner certifies, on Form T2201, Disability Tax Credit Certificate, that the child has a severe and prolonged impairment in physical or mental functions, and the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) approves the form. You can send the form to the CRA at any time during the year.\nFor general questions related to the CDB, call 1-800-387-1193 or for information related to the DTC, call 1-800-959-8281.\nHow much you can expect to receive\nYour CDB payments are calculated using the following information:\nnumber of eligible children\nadjusted family net income (AFNI)\nmarital status\nEvery July, your CDB payments are recalculated based on your AFNI from the previous year.\nFor example, July 2022 to June 2023 payments are based on your income from your 2021 tax return; and July 2021 to June 2022 payments are based on your income from your 2020 tax return.\nFor the period of July 2022 to June 2023, you could get up to $2,985 ($248.75 per month) for each child who is eligible for the DTC.\nThe benefit starts being reduced when the adjusted family net income is greater than $71,060. The reduction is calculated as follows:\nFor families with one child eligible for the benefit, the reduction is 3.2% of the amount of adjusted family net income greater than $71,060.\nFor families with two or more children eligible for the benefit, the reduction is 5.7% of the amount of adjusted family net income greater than $71,060.\nYou can use the child and family benefits calculator to estimate how much you will get.\nNote:\nIf this is the first time you\u2019re getting the CDB, the CRA will automatically calculate your payments for the current and two previous benefit years. The benefit year runs from July of one year to June of the following year. For years before that, send a written request to your tax centre.\nTo continue getting benefits\nYou must remain eligible for the CCB and your child must also remain eligible for the DTC.\nTo avoid delays or interruption in your benefit payments, you need to do your taxes on time every year, even if you had no income at all or your income is tax exempt. If you have a spouse or common-law partner, they also need to do their taxes on time every year. The CRA uses the information from your income tax and benefit return to calculate your benefit and credit payments.\nTo make sure you are getting the right amount of benefits and credits, you must also keep your personal information updated with the CRA.\nLeaving an abusive or violent situation?

In 2023, this amount is $18,508.36 (before tax).\nOnce you have earned $6,600 (before tax) in 2023, you must contact Service Canada. Your disability benefits may be impacted by your gross (before tax) earnings:\nif you earn below $6,600 (before tax), this alone should not affect your disability benefits\nif you earn between $6,600 and $18,508.36 (before tax), this may show that you are regularly capable of working and it may affect your disability benefits\nif you earn $18,508.36 (before tax) or more, this demonstrates you are regularly capable of working and you will likely no longer qualify for disability benefits\nYou need to advise Service Canada when you reach any of these amounts and you should call when you start working.\u00a0This does not necessarily mean that your benefits will stop.

They help show your ongoing eligibility and make sure you get the benefits to which you're entitled.\nYou'll need your social insurance number and the 4-digit access code we mailed you to submit your reports online or by phone. Once you submit your report, you'll get the date to submit your next one. You have 3 weeks from that date to complete the next report.\nIf you work or earn money, you must indicate it on your report. If you don't inform Service Canada, you risk being overpaid and having to repay benefits.\nFor more information on how earnings impact your benefits, visit Working while on claim.\nWhen payments start\nYou'll receive your first payment about 28 days after you apply if you're eligible and have provided all required information. If you're not eligible, we'll notify you of the decision made about your application.\nWaiting period\nBefore you start receiving benefits, there is 1 week for which you won't be paid. This is called the waiting period. It's like the deductible that you pay for other types of insurance.\nWhen payments stop\nYou stop receiving benefits if:\nyou receive all the weeks of benefits to which you were entitled\nthe payment timeframe during which you can receive benefits ends\nyou stop filing your bi-weekly report\nyou request a termination of your claim to file a new claim\nIf you start working before you finish your current EI claim, you must tell us when you complete your EI report so we can adjust or stop your claim, depending on whether the work is full-time, part-time or by contract. If the work is short-term or a contract, you may re-activate your EI claim and continue to receive your biweekly payments when you\u2019re laid off.\nIf you disagree with the decision about your application for EI benefits\nYou can request a reconsideration of the decision. You must submit a request for reconsideration within 30 days after the decision was communicated to you.

In regions of Canada with the lowest rates of unemployment, we\u2019ll use the best 22 weeks. In other regions, the number of weeks used to calculate benefits will be somewhere between 14 and 22, depending on the unemployment rate in those regions.\nRequired number of best weeks by regional rate of unemployment\nRegional rate of unemployment\nRequired weeks\n6% or less\n22\n6.1% to 7%\n21\n7.1% to 8%\n20\n8.1% to 9%\n19\n9.1% to 10%\n18\n10.1% to 11%\n17\n11.1% to 12%\n16\n12.1% to 13%\n15\n13.1% or more\n14\nTo find out the rate of unemployment in your region, visit EI Program Characteristics.\nOnce the weekly benefit rate is established, it will remain unchanged over the life of your claim.\nIf your net family income is $25,921 or less\nIf your net family income doesn\u2019t exceed $25,921 per year, you have children and you or your spouse receives the Canada Child Benefit, you\u2019re considered a member of a low-income family. Therefore, you may be eligible to receive the EI family supplement.\nThe family supplement rate is based on:\nyour net family income up to a maximum of $25,921 per year\nthe number of children in the family and their ages\nThe family supplement may increase your benefit rate up to 80% of your average insurable earnings. If you and your spouse claim EI benefits at the same time, only 1 of you can receive the family supplement. It is generally better for the spouse with the lower benefit rate to receive the supplement.\nAs your income level rises, the Family Supplement gradually decreases, so that when the maximum income of $25,921 is reached no supplement is payable.\nTaxes are deducted from EI payments\nEI benefits are taxable, no matter what type of benefits you receive. Federal and provincial or territorial taxes, where applicable, will therefore be deducted from your payment.\nRelated links\nSubmitting EI reports\nChecklist: Employment Insurance regular benefits application\nMy Service Canada Account\nVariable best weeks\nEI earning charts\nEI and the various types of earnings\nEI economic regions\nContact us\nEI contact EI information - Individuals\nDocument navigation\nPrevious - Do you qualify\nNext - Apply\nPage feedback\nDid you find what you were looking for?\nYes Yes No\nIf not, tell us why below:\nWhat was wrong?\nI can't find the information\nThe information is hard to understand\nThere was an error or something didn't work\nOther reason\nPlease provide more details (maximum 300 characters)\nYou will not receive a reply.

If you earn any money above this 90%, we'll deduct it dollar for dollar from your benefits.\nFor more information, visit the Working While on Claim page.\nWhen you work and receive benefits at the same time, you must report your work earnings and hours for each week you work, in the week in which the work occurred.\nIf you receive other payments while receiving EI, some types of earnings will be deducted from your EI benefits, while other types of income have no impact on your EI benefits. You can refer to the earnings chart to find out if a payment constitutes earnings for benefit purposes and, if so, how those earnings are allocated.\nIf you travel outside of Canada\nYou\u2019re not usually eligible to receive regular benefits while you\u2019re away from Canada. However, you may receive regular benefits if you show that you\u2019re available for work in Canada while abroad. You must also notify us of your travel on My Service Canada Account (MSCA) or through your bi-weekly report.\nYou can be outside Canada for a period of 7 consecutive days for the purpose of:\nattending the funeral of a member of your immediate family or a close relative\naccompanying a member of your immediate family to a medical facility, provided that the treatment sought is not readily available in the family member's area of residence in Canada\nvisiting a member of your immediate family who is seriously ill or injured\nattending a bona fide job interview\nYou can be away from Canada for a period of 14 consecutive days for the purpose of conducting a bona fide job search.\nIf you indicate that you\u2019ve taken measures to be reached if an employment opportunity presents itself during your absence and that you\u2019re able to return to Canada within 48 hours, we\u2019ll accept that you\u2019ve proven your availability.\nOne measure we take to enforce this rule is to compare EI information with information from the Canada Border Services Agency. If we find you\u2019ve been out of the country while collecting benefits, we\u2019ll determine whether you were entitled to receive those benefits. If you weren\u2019t entitled to receive them, we\u2019ll calculate how much we overpaid you, and you\u2019ll then have to repay the benefits.\nWe may also impose penalties of up to 3 times your weekly benefit rate or 3 times the amount of your overpayment. As well, you may have to work more hours or, in the case of fishing benefits, you may need more insurable earnings to qualify for benefits in the future.\nYou can receive different types of benefits one after the other\nYou can normally receive up to 50 weeks of benefits when regular benefits are combined with maternity, parental, sickness or caregiving benefits in the same benefit period (of 52 weeks).\nThe only exception is when EI regular benefits and extended parental benefits are paid during the 52-week period. As extended parental benefits are paid at a benefit rate of 33% of your average weekly insurable earnings, once 50 weeks of benefits have been paid, the weeks of extended parental benefits will be converted to an equivalent number of weeks that would have been paid at the 55% benefit rate. This conversion will determine how many more weeks of regular benefits and special benefits can be paid to reach the equivalent of 50 weeks paid at the 55% benefits rate. Any weeks where you return to work during this period will be considered weeks paid for the purposes of calculating the equivalent of 50 weeks paid at the 55% benefit rate. Once the number of additional weeks that can be paid is determined, the 52-week benefit period will be extended to allow for the additional weeks to be paid.\nIt's important to note that you can\u2019t receive more than 1 type of benefit at the same time.\nIf you\u2019re not well, someone else can manage your benefits for you\nIf you\u2019re unable to manage your own affairs due to health problems, a person other than an Employment and Social Development Canada employee may be appointed to act on your behalf. In that case, the form Appointment of Representative must be completed and returned with your EI application.\nIf you\u2019re eligible for EI, we\u2019ll authorize the payment of benefits to the representative acting on your behalf.\nRequesting EI benefits on behalf of a deceased person\nWhen a person dies, EI benefits payable to that person up to and including the day of the death may be paid to the legal representative Footnote 1 , or to a person authorized to inherit property of the deceased person.\nIf the deceased person had not applied for EI benefits, the legal representative must do the following, in the name of the deceased person, before benefits can be paid:\napply for benefits in the name of the deceased person\ncomplete the form Request for Payment of Benefit on Behalf of a Deceased Person\nprovide a death certificate issued by the province or territory, a certificate from the director of a funeral home or an administrator of a hospital or clinic, or a letter from a physician, graduate nurse, or member of the clergy\nIf the deceased person was receiving EI benefits before death, the legal representative must complete the form Request for Payment of Benefit on Behalf of a Deceased Person to cancel these benefits.\nIf EI benefits are paid after the death of someone in your family, the legal representative must repay the overpayment by making a cheque or money order to the Receiver General for Canada and sending it to the nearest overpayment recovery office.\nIt is important to notify the federal government of a death as quickly as possible to avoid overpayment of other benefit types.\nWork-Sharing\nThe EI Work-Sharing Program assists employers and employees facing lay-offs due to a decline in production. With the Work-Sharing agreement, available work is redistributed through a voluntary reduction in hours worked by all employees within 1 or more work units. This enables the employer to retain a full work force on a reduced work week, rather than laying off part of his or her work force. Employees are able to remain on the job and maintain skills and working habits and avoid uncertainties and hardship associated with total unemployment.\nSituations where you may owe money\nDeductions can never be taken for money owed directly to a person or company. However, deductions can be taken from your EI benefits to repay money you owe, if:\nyou received an overpayment from EI\nyou received an advance or assistance from the Government of Canada or any of its agencies, a provincial or municipal government, or any other authority and an arrangement has been taken with EI for the deduction. Your consent must be given in writing to the deduction and payment by EI. Example: you received an advance from a Social Services agency while waiting for your EI benefits to start\nthe Department of Justice issued a court order, according to the Family Orders and Agreements (FOA) Enforcement Assistance Act. Your EI benefits are garnished and forwarded to the Department of Justice that ensures payment to your spouse / dependents, according to the existing court order\nthe Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) may collect taxes owing according to the Income Tax Act, the Excise Tax Act or other provisions enforced by the CRA. Any taxes owing to federal or provincial governments may be garnished from your EI benefits\nA mistake on your EI report can affect your claim\nWe work to protect the EI program from misuse. One of the ways we do this is by working with employers and claimants to ensure the accuracy of the information we receive. With your help, we can reduce the amount of misuse and ensure that the EI program is used as it should be \u2014 as a program that provides temporary financial assistance to individuals who qualify.\nA mistake is an unintentional act. We know claimants can make mistakes when filing their reports.\nCommon mistakes include:\nestimating weekly earnings instead of putting in the actual amount earned\ndeclaring net earnings instead of gross earnings\nforgetting to declare all the earnings received\nwriting or entering the wrong number when reporting earnings, or\nadding the number of hours or amount of earnings incorrectly\nSome mistakes can delay benefit payments, while others can affect the amount of benefits you receive \u2014 meaning you were paid more or less than you were entitled to receive.\nEstimating your earnings can have the following effects:\nif you estimated your earnings for 1 week and your estimate was higher than the earnings you actually received, your benefit amount will be less than it should have been. If this happens, let us know and we\u2019ll adjust your file to make sure you receive all the benefits to which you\u2019re entitled\nif you estimated your earnings for 1 week and your estimate was lower than the earnings you actually received, your benefit amount will be higher than it should have been. Let us know if this happens. You\u2019ll have to repay the excess amount, but we\u2019ll ensure that repaying it causes no undue hardship. As well, we\u2019ll adjust your file to reflect your accurate information\nIf you notice a mistake on a completed form or report, or if there is a change in your circumstances that could affect your EI claim, tell Service Canada immediately. This will help prevent any future problems with your claim.\nYou may be penalized if you make a false statement related to your claim\nA misrepresentation occurs when someone knowingly completes a statement without declaring essential information, , makes false or misleading representations or statements, or misrepresents facts to make a false claim for benefits. You could face severe monetary penalties or prosecution in these cases. However, if you disclose your actions to Service Canada before an investigation begins, we may waive any monetary penalties and prosecutions that might otherwise apply.\nHere is an example of a situation where penalties may be imposed:\nAn EI benefit claimant goes on an ocean cruise for a month and arranges for a friend to conceal their absence by signing and returning 2 EI reports. As a result, the claimant illegally received $350 in benefits for each of the 4 weeks of the cruise. After investigation, we find that this was the first time the claimant and the friend had misused the EI system. As well, we find that they both knew that what they did was illegal but they did it anyway.\nIn this case, the claimant will have to repay $1,400 (4 weeks of benefits at $350 per week) and may have to pay a penalty of $700 ($350 for each of the 2 false reports filed during the holiday). The friend may also have to pay a penalty of $700 for the illegal act of filing 2 false reports on behalf of the claimant.\nThere are many situations when a penalty may apply, and the amount could become very high. Depending on the circumstances, the maximum penalty could be up to 3 times the amount of the overpayment, 3 times the weekly benefit rate for each incident of misrepresentation, or 3 times the maximum benefit rate. This could also affect your future benefits.\nIf you receive more than you're entitled to, you\u2019ll have a debt to repay\nWhen EI claimants receive benefits to which they are not entitled, the amount of the overpayment counts as a debt that must be repaid.\nWe charge interest on this debt when it results from claimants who knowingly withhold information or make false or misleading representations or statements. However, we do not charge interest on debt that results when we make an error in the benefit payment.\nThe rate of interest is the Bank of Canada average rate plus 3%.

Be under the age of 65\nYou can receive CPP disability benefits only until you are 65.\n2. Meet the minimum contributory requirements\nTo meet the minimum contributory requirements, you must:\nhave made valid contributions to the CPP in 4 of the last 6 years, or\nhave contributed for at least 25 years, including 3 of the last 6 years, or\nmeet the requirements for the late applicant provision\nHow CPP contributions work\nThe Canada Pension Plan operates everywhere in Canada, except in Quebec, where the Quebec Pension Plan (QPP) applies.\nYou automatically contribute to the CPP, based on what you earn above $3,500 to a maximum annual amount. This annual amount is called pensionable earnings. The maximum amount is set each January, based on the average wage in Canada.\nYou do not contribute:\nwhile you receive CPP disability benefits\nduring periods when you have no earnings, or\nwhen your annual earnings are $3,500 or less\nYour contributory period\nYour contributory period starts when you reach age 18. Your contributory period ends when you start receiving your CPP retirement pension, turn 70, or die (whichever happens first).\nService Canada uses the contributory period to:\ndetermine if you meet the CPP contribution requirements, and\ncalculate the amount of CPP benefits you are eligible to receive\nService Canada looks at:\nhow long you contribute, and\nhow much you contribute to the CPP\nThe more you earn and contribute to the CPP, the higher your payment will be.\nNote\nWith very few exceptions, everyone over the age of 18 who works in Canada outside of Quebec and earns more than the Disability Basic Exemption ($6,600 per year in 2023) makes a valid contribution toward CPP disability benefits.\n3. Have a mental or physical disability that regularly stops you from doing any type of substantially gainful work\nTo receive these benefits, you must have a mental or physical disability that regularly stops you from doing any type of work. This means that your disability usually or always prevents you from doing any substantially gainful work. Work capacity can be demonstrated through paid work, volunteer activities, educational activities, or any combination of these activities. Your condition must be both severe and prolonged when you apply.\nWhat does the CPP mean by severe\nA person is considered to have a severe disability if they are regularly incapable of pursuing any substantially gainful occupation.\nBeing regularly incapable means that you are usually or always incapable. A Service Canada medical adjudicator will determine whether you meet this requirement.\nAn occupation is any profession or work a person might do to earn a living. If the total annual amount of earnings from this work is more than 12 times the maximum monthly CPP disability benefit amount, the work is considered to be substantially gainful.\nWhat does CPP mean by prolonged\nYour disability is long-term and of indefinite duration or is likely to result in death.\nBeing eligible for a disability benefits from other government programs or from private insurers does not automatically mean you are eligible for CPP disability benefits.\nPost-retirement disability benefit\nThe CPP post-retirement disability benefit is intended for people receiving the CPP retirement pension who are. You can get this monthly payment if you:\nare under the age of 65\nhave made the minimum amount of valid CPP and/or Quebec Pension Plan (QPP) contributions\nhave a mental and/or physical medical condition(s) that prevents you from regularly working at any substantially gainful job. Your medical condition(s) must be found to be both severe and prolonged as defined by the CPP, and\nare already receiving the CPP retirement pensions for more than 15 months or become disabled after starting to receive your retirement pension\nThe post-retirement disability benefit amount is equal to the flat-rate portion of the disability benefit and will increase in January every year with the cost of living. In 2023 it is $558.74.\nChildren of someone receiving this benefit may be eligible for the disabled contributor's children's benefit.\nThe post-retirement disability benefit ends:\nthe month you turns 65, or\nthe month you are no longer deemed to be disabled, or\nthe month of death\nCPP disability benefits eligibility map\nIf you have any questions about your eligibility or continuing eligibility, please contact Service Canada.

When you work in Quebec you contribute to the Quebec Pension Plan (QPP) instead of to the CPP.\nYou must apply for QPP disability benefits if:\nyou worked only in Quebec, or\nyou currently live in Quebec and have contributed to both the CPP and QPP, or\nyou have worked in Quebec, currently live outside Canada and your last province of residence was Quebec\nIf you have a terminal illness\nFor the purposes of CPP, a terminal medical condition is a disease state that cannot be cured or adequately treated and is reasonably expected to result in death within 6 months. There is a different application form to complete: the Terminal Illness Application for a Disability Benefit under the Canada Pension Plan (ISP2530A).\nService Canada's goal is to process your application within 5 business days of receiving a complete terminal illness application. If employment or medical information is missing, the decision may take longer.\nIf you have a grave medical condition\nA grave condition is a rapidly progressive medical condition. A list of grave conditions was developed based on extensive research by ESDC. These conditions have a high probability of meeting the CPP disability eligibility criteria.\nOur goal is to make a decision for applicants with grave medical conditions within 30 calendar days. When you apply for CPP disability benefits with the Application for Canada Pension Plan Disability Benefits (ISP1151) and Medical Report for a Canada Pension Plan Disability Benefit (ISP2519), Service Canada will determine whether you have one of these conditions based on the information in the application.\nThe list of grave medical conditions can be found on the Canada Pension Plan disability benefits webpage.\nService Canada\u2019s Service Standards\nOur goal is to make a decision within these timeframes (all timeframes refer to calendar days, except for the terminal illness standard of 5 business days).\nCPP disability benefits application\nWithin 120 days of receiving a complete application.\nGrave medical condition(s)\nWithin 30 days of receiving a complete application.\nTerminal illness\nWithin 5 business days of receiving a complete application.\nReconsideration\nYou can request a reconsideration within 90 days of receiving the letter notifying you of the decision. Service Canada will inform you of the decision within 120 days of receiving your request for reconsideration.\nProvisions\nOne or more of the following provisions could help you qualify for CPP disability benefits or increase the amount you receive.\nChild-rearing provision\nIf you stopped working or worked less to care for a child under the age of 7, the child-rearing provision may help you qualify for CPP disability benefits or increase your benefit amount. The child-rearing provision allows you to not count a period of low earnings or no earnings when you were raising your child.\nThe child-rearing provision may apply to you if:\nyou did not work or had low earnings because you were the primary caregiver of your child under the age of 7, and\nyou have received Family Allowance payments or been eligible for the Canada child tax benefit or Canada child benefit (even if you did not receive the benefit)\nThe CPP considers the primary caregiver to be the person who is most responsible for the daily needs of the child (or children) until the age of 7. Some examples of the responsibilities of the primary caregiver are:\nsupervising the child\npreparing meals\ngoing to school meetings and events; and\nattending the child's medical appointments\nNote\nOnly one parent can qualify for any child-rearing provision periods.\nLate applicant provision\nThe late applicant provision may help you qualify for CPP disability benefits if you did not apply when you first became disabled.\nYou may be eligible if:\nyou had the required amount of CPP contributions and the required number of years of CPP contributions on the date you first became disabled (as defined by the CPP legislation), and\nyou have been continuously disabled (as defined by the CPP legislation) from that date up to the present\nYou do not have to apply separately for this provision. It will automatically be considered when you apply for CPP disability benefits.\nIncapacity provision\nThe incapacity provision supports you if you were previously mentally or physically incapable of forming or expressing the intent to apply for CPP disability benefits.\nThis provision may allow Service Canada to deem an application to have been received at an earlier date.\nThere is a time limit after you regain the capacity to apply.\nContact Service Canada by phone or in person to have the Declaration of Incapacity \u2013 Physician's Report sent to you. (Consult section 8: Contact us)\nCredit splitting upon separation, divorce or end of a common-law relationship\nThe CPP contributions you and your former spouse or former common-law partner made during the time you lived together may be equally divided after a divorce, separation, or the end of your common-law relationship.\nInternational social security agreements and the Canada Pension Plan\nIf you have lived or worked in Canada and in another country, and you do not meet the contributory requirements for CPP disability benefits, one of Canada's international social security agreements may help you qualify.\n2.0 Children's benefit\nIn this section\nDisabled contributor's children's benefit\nEligibility\nHow to apply for a children's benefit\nWho receives the payment\nDisabled contributor's children's benefit\nThe Canada Pension Plan children's benefits provide monthly payments to the dependent children of disabled or deceased CPP contributors.\nThere are 2 types of CPP children's benefits:\na disabled contributor's children's benefit \u2013 a monthly payment for a child of the person receiving a CPP disability benefit\na surviving children's benefit \u2013 a monthly payment for a child of the deceased contributor.

The date your application form is received may affect the date your benefit begins. Do not wait for your completed medical form before sending your completed application form.\nHowever, a decision on your application can only be made when you have sent both of the following:\na complete application form (including questionnaire and signed consent form), and\na signed medical report\nWe aim to make a decision on your eligibility within 120 calendar days (4 months).\nIf we confirm your condition is grave, we aim to process your application within 30 calendar days.\nIf we confirm you have a terminal illness, we aim to process your application within 5 business days.\nWhen will I receive my benefit\nYour disability benefit payment usually begins in the 120 days after Service Canada determines that you are eligible for a CPP disability benefit. For example, if Service Canada determines that you were disabled in July, then you will start receiving your benefit payment in November.\nYou may receive up to 12 months of retroactive payments from the date your application was received.\nHow much can I receive\nYour decision letter will give you the amount of your monthly payment.\nThe basic payment amount is $558.74. We add to the basic amount based on how much you paid into the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) while you worked. With the introduction of CPP enhancement in 2019, the monthly maximum disability amount increases every month. In 2023, the monthly amount in January was $1,538.67 and will increase to $1,546.05 in December.\nThe post-retirement disability benefit is the same flat rate ($558.74 in 2023). It does not matter how much or for how long you contributed to the Canada Pension Plan.\nCPP disability payments are taxable income\nTaxes are not automatically deducted each month. You can ask that federal income tax be deducted from your monthly payment by:\nsigning into your My Service Canada Account\ncompleting the Request for voluntary Federal Income tax Deductions CPP/OAS (ISP-3520CPP) form and mailing it to us or dropping it off at a Service Canada office, or\ncalling Service Canada at 1-800-277-9914 or 1-800-255-4786 (TTY)\nIf you do not ask for monthly tax deductions, you may have to pay your income tax each quarter.\nReceiving disability income from another source\nIf you are receiving disability income from other sources, such as a private insurance company or a provincial or territorial social assistance program, you may still be eligible for CPP disability benefits, but the other sources may reduce their payments.\nContact your insurance company or social assistance program for details about your case.\nReceiving more than one Canada Pension Plan benefit\nIf you are eligible for both a CPP survivor\u2019s pension and a CPP disability pension, they will be combined into a single monthly payment. If you are eligible for the CPP post-retirement disability benefit, it will be paid as a separate monthly payment.\nIf you are receiving a combined retirement and survivor pension, and are then granted a post-retirement disability benefit, you will receive the higher amount of the survivor or post-retirement disability benefit flat rate.\nRequest for reconsideration\nIf you disagree with Service Canada's decision on your application for CPP disability benefits, you can ask for a reconsideration within 90 days of receiving a decision letter.\nWhat is a reconsideration\nA reconsideration is a review of your application by a Service Canada staff member who was not involved in making the original decision. They will also review any new information that you provide or others provide for you. Service Canada staff may also seek more medical information about your case.\nHow do I request a reconsideration\nThere are 3 ways to request a reconsideration:\nOption 1: submit your request online using My Service Canada Account (MSCA)\nOption 2: complete the Request for Reconsideration of a Canada Pension Plan Disability Decision form (ISP-1145) and mail it to the return address on the decision letter or bring it to a Service Canada office\nOption 3: write a letter to Service Canada and include:\nyour name\nyour address\nyour telephone number\nyour Social Insurance Number or Client Identification Number\na detailed explanation of why you do not agree with the decision\nany new information that could affect the decision, and\nyour signature and the date\nSubmit the letter:\nelectronically by signing into My Service Canada Account (MSCA)\nby mail to the return address on the decision letter, or\nin person at a Service Canada office\nReconsideration takes about 120 days. Service Canada will inform you by mail of the decision and the reasons for the decision.\nComplete and send your request to Service Canada right away, even if you are waiting for additional information that you would like to provide us for reconsideration. You can log into your MSCA at any time to upload documents in support of your request.\nNote\nService Canada will start reviewing your request for reconsideration once we receive all the information.\nIf you disagree with the reconsideration decision\nIf you disagree with the reconsideration decision, the next step is to appeal to the Social Security Tribunal. To do this, complete the Canada Pension Plan Notice of Appeal \u2013 Income Security \u2013 General Division form.\nFor more information, contact the Social Security Tribunal:\nby email: info.sst-tss@canada.gc.ca\nby phone from 7\u00a0am to 7\u00a0pm Eastern time: Monday to Friday: 1-877-227-8577 (toll-free in Canada and the USA)\n613-437-1640 (from outside Canada and the USA, call collect)\nTTY: 1-866-873-8381\nExtension request\nIf you have already applied for CPP disability benefits but you have an upcoming medical appointment that might affect your eligibility, you can ask Service Canada to delay deciding whether you are eligible. You can ask for an extension the first time you apply or when you request a reconsideration. To request an extension, contact Service Canada.\nWhen do the benefits stop\nYour disability benefits will continue as long as you continue to have a severe and prolonged disability (according to the CPP), which prevents you from regularly working. CPP disability benefits are not necessarily permanent. They are long-term benefits that are intended to partially replace your employment income for as long as your disability regularly prevents you from working.\nWhen you reach 65 years old, your disability benefit will automatically be changed to a CPP retirement pension.\nIf you are receiving the CPP post-retirement disability benefit, it will stop when you reach age 65, and you will continue to receive only your CPP retirement pension.\nThe CPP retirement pension will likely be less than your disability benefit. However, you may then qualify for the Old Age Security (OAS) pension and the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS).\nWhen CPP disability benefits stop, any related disabled contributor\u2019s child\u2019s benefits also stop.\n5.0 Important information\nIn this section\nYour responsibilities\nParticipating in work, school or volunteer activities\nTax considerations\nIn case of death\nReassessment of eligibility\nOverpayments\nYour responsibilities\nYou need to tell Service Canada when:\nyou have earned $6,600 (before tax) in 2023 and you should call when you return to work (including self-employment)\nyou are attending school and/or volunteering for 15 hours or more per week for 4 months or more\nyour medical condition improves enough that you may be able to return to work\nyour mailing address, telephone number, or bank account used for direct deposit changes, and/or\nyour custody and control of dependent children starts or ends (including by birth, adoption, marriage, common-law relationship, or death)\nReporting a return to work, school, or volunteer activities does not necessarily mean your benefits will stop. Instead, it is an opportunity for Service Canada to support you with information about our work-related supports and services.\nParticipating in work, school or volunteer activities\nVolunteering or going to school while receiving CPP disability benefits\nService Canada recognizes the importance of volunteer work, education, and training. Many of our clients can participate in volunteer work and education/training, and they continue to receive their disability benefits. However, sometimes this can signal your ability to work and can impact whether you still qualify to receive disability benefits.\nWhen you are volunteering (in-person or online) or going to school (in-person or online) you must contact Service Canada if:\nyou are doing any combination of these activities for 15 hours a week or more, and\nyou have been doing these activities on a regular basis for 4 continuous months or longer\nYou must also tell Service Canada if you successfully complete a school, university, college, trade, technical training, or rehabilitation program.\nWorking and earning money while receiving CPP disability benefits\nYou must contact Service Canada when you begin working, and once you have earned $6,600 (before tax) in 2023. Your disability benefits may be impacted by your gross (before tax) earnings.\nIf you earn below $6,600 (before tax), this alone should not affect your disability benefits\nIf you earn between $6,600 and $18,508.36 (before tax), this may show that you are regularly capable of working and it may affect your disability benefits\nIf you earn $18,508.36 (before tax) or more, this demonstrates you are regularly capable of working and you will likely no longer qualify for disability benefits\nIf you delay in contacting us when you start making over the allowed amount, you might have to pay some money back.\nSelf-employment while receiving CPP disability benefits\nThe same rules apply when you are self-employed. You need to contact Service Canada once you reach $6,600 in gross business earnings (before tax) and you should call as soon as you begin working. Service Canada will review your file and look at a number of factors to determine if you still qualify for disability benefits. These factors include how involved you are in the everyday activities of the business, and the gross earnings of the business.\nIf your disability reoccurs within 2 years\nIf you are no longer able to continue working, volunteering or attending school because of the same or related disability, your disability benefits can be quickly reinstated. This means you can ask to have your benefits started again without having to go through the usual application process. You may qualify for automatic reinstatement if:\nyou notified Service Canada about your return to work, volunteer, and/or school attendance before your benefits stopped\nyou stopped receiving disability benefits because you returned to work, volunteered, and/or attended school\nyour benefit stopped within the last 2 years\nyour same or related disability reoccurred within 2 years, and\nyou contacted Service Canada within 1 year of stopping work, volunteering, and/or school attendance\nyou met the earnings and contributions requirements\nIf your children are still eligible, their disabled contributor's children's benefit will also be reinstated.\n*Some restrictions apply to reinstate the CPP post-retirement disability benefit. Contact Service Canada for details.\nIf your disability reoccurs within 5 years\nYou may qualify for a fast-track reapplication if:\nyou stopped receiving disability benefits because you have returned to work\nyour benefits stopped within the last 5 years\nyour same or related disability reoccurred within 5 years\nyou contacted Service Canada within 1 year of stopping work, and\nyou met the earnings and contributions requirements\nIf your children are still eligible, their disabled contributor's children's benefit will also be reinstated.\nVocational Rehabilitation Program for recipients of Canada Pension Plan disability benefits\nThe Vocational Rehabilitation Program is a voluntary program that helps suitable CPP disability beneficiaries return to work. If you are thinking of returning to work, a variety of services such as guidance, training, and job placement may be available.\nWhile you participate in the program, you continue to receive your regular CPP disability benefits, including while you search for a job.\nTo participate in this program, contact Service Canada.\nThree-month work trial while receiving CPP disability benefits\nIf you return to work on a regular basis, you may be able to continue to receive your disability benefits for 3 months. This gives you and Service Canada time to evaluate your ability to work regularly.\nIf you are still capable of working after 3 months, your CPP disability benefits will likely stop.\nTax considerations\nDisability Tax Credit (DTC)\nYou may be eligible for the Disability Tax Credit administered by the Canada Revenue Agency, which could reduce the amount of income tax you may have to pay.\nTo apply, you must:\ncomplete Part A of the Disability Tax Credit Certificate (T2201)\nask a medical practitioner to complete Part B and certify that you have a severe and prolonged impairment and describe the effects of this impairment\nonce the Disability Tax Credit Certificate (T2201) is complete, send the form to the Disability Tax Credit Union at Canada Revenue Agency, and\nmail the form to the address indicated on the last page of the Certificate\nWorking Income Tax Benefit (WITB)\nThe Working Income Tax Benefit (WITB) is a refundable tax credit that provides tax relief for eligible low-income individuals and families who have employment or business income.\nIf you qualify for both the DTC and the WITB, you may qualify to claim the WITB Disability Supplement. For more information, visit Canada.ca/taxes or call the CRA at 1-800-959-8281. For TTY service, call 1-800-665-0354.\nNote\nService Canada\u2019s definition of disability is different from the definition used by the Canada Revenue Agency.\nIn case of death\nWhat if I die before starting to receive CPP disability benefits?\nIf you signed a Canada Pension Plan Disability Benefits Application (ISP1151) and Service Canada receives it before your death, we will continue to process your application. If it is approved, any money payable up to the date of death will be sent to your estate.\nIf you signed your application for a disability benefit and Service Canada receives it after you die, your application must be denied.\nIn either case, your estate may be eligible to receive the CPP death benefit. Your survivors may be eligible for the CPP survivor's pension and surviving children's benefit.\nReassessment of eligibility\nFrom time to time, cases are reviewed to ensure that only eligible people receive disability benefits.\nIf your case is being reviewed, you may be asked to provide current medical and other information. Because everyone's medical condition and capacity to work is unique, each case is looked at individually.\nOnce all the necessary information has been collected, a decision to continue or stop disability benefits is made. We will inform you of this decision in writing.\nOverpayments\nIf you receive payments to which you are not entitled, you will have to pay them back.\n6.0 Glossary and resources\nIn this section\nGlossary of terms\nLinks to other resources\nGlossary of terms\nNote\nIn case of conflict between the interpretation of terminology in this toolkit and the terminology of the Canada Pension Plan and Regulations, the terminology of the Plan and Regulations prevail.\nAllowable earnings\nThe maximum amount that a CPP disability beneficiary can earn in a calendar year without notifying Service Canada. In 2023, the amount is $6,600 (gross amount).\nAutomatic reinstatement\nIf a person cannot continue working because their disability reoccurs within a 2-year period, their CPP disability benefits can be reinstated automatically.

This increases your CPP disability benefit payment. It may also help you have enough years of contributions to be eligible for CPP disability benefits.\nCustody and control\nIncludes formal and informal custody and control arrangements, including sole custody, shared custody and joint custody.\nDependent child\nA biological or adopted (legally or 'in fact') child of a CPP disability beneficiary or a child in the beneficiary's care and custody.

Contributions in 4 of the last 6 years\nWho\nZan is 32 years old and stopped working this month because of a severe and prolonged medical condition (according to CPP legislation).\nScenario\nZan applies for the CPP disability pension. His salary was $45,000 per year. He contributed to the CPP in 4 of the last 6 years.\nOutcome\nZan is eligible and starts receiving the CPP disability pension.\n2. 25 years of contributions with contributions in 3 of the last 6 years\nWho\nJamie started working and contributing to the CPP at age 18.\nScenario\nAfter working for 22 years, at age 40 Jamie decided to return to school to change careers. At age 45 Jamie went back to work. He contributed to the CPP for 3 years before having to stop work due to a terminal illness. Jamie has contributed to the CPP for at least 25 years, with contributions in 3 of the last 6 years.\nOutcome\nJamie is eligible for the CPP disability pension.\n3. Late applicant provision\nWho\nWayan had to stop working several years ago because of a severe and prolonged medical condition (according to CPP legislation). He did not apply for CPP disability benefits until recently.\nScenario\nIn the 6 years before becoming disabled, Wayan contributed to the CPP for 4 years. His annual earnings were more than the Disability Basic Exemption.\nOutcome\nWayan is eligible for CPP disability benefits based on the late applicant provision. He will receive 12 months of retroactive payments from the date Service Canada received his application.\n4. Credit splitting\nWho\nRishi and Roni were married for many years and have now separated. Rishi never worked because of a disability, while Roni worked and contributed to the CPP. Rishi had not been receiving CPP disability benefits because he had no CPP contributions.\nScenario\nRishi contacts Service Canada to apply for a division of pension credits. The CPP contributions Roni made while they lived together are combined, then divided equally between them.\nOutcome\nRishi now has valid contributions to be considered for CPP disability benefits.\n5. International social security agreements\nWho\nPaz contributed to the social security system of Peru for many years before immigrating to Canada. Paz began working in Canada upon his arrival, but within 2 years, he had to stop work because of a severe and prolonged medical condition.\nScenario\nPaz does not have enough contributions to CPP to be considered for CPP disability benefits. However, since March 2017, Canada has an international social security agreement with Peru.\nOutcome\nPaz can be considered for CPP disability benefits. By combining his years of contributions to the Peruvian social security system with those to the Canada Pension Plan, Paz will meet the requirement for contributions in 4 of the last 6 years. The amount that Paz receives will be based only on his CPP contributions. Paz should consider applying for a disability pension from Peru as well.\n6. Child-rearing provision\nWho\nChris recently stopped working because of a severe and prolonged medical condition.\nScenario\nHe had previously been out of the workforce to look after his daughter since she was born 6 years ago. During that time, Chris received the child tax benefit/Canada child benefit.\nBefore his daughter was born, Chris had worked half-days for 4 years.\nOutcome\nChris does not have enough CPP contributions in the last 6 years to qualify for CPP disability benefits. However, the child-rearing provision allows Chris to exclude the last 6 years.\nChris is eligible for CPP disability benefits because he has 4 years of contributions in the 6 years before he stayed home to raise his daughter.\n7. Applying for the post-retirement disability benefit\nWho\nCarl began to receive his retirement pension at age 60 after 40 years of work. He had a disabling event occur at age 62.\nScenario\nSince Carl has been receiving his retirement pension for more than 15 months, he is no longer eligible for a CPP Disability benefit. If Carl has contributions to the CPP in 3 of the last 6 years prior to the year he applied, he may be eligible to receive the post-retirement disability benefit.\nOutcome\nIf the post-retirement disability benefit is approved, Service Canada will send him a monthly amount equal to the flat-rate portion of the disability pension as a top-up to his retirement pension.\nDisabled contributor's children's benefit examples\n1. Child under 18 years of age who is in the care and custody of the disabled contributor\nWho\nLane is the legal guardian of Lee, aged 11.\nScenario\nLane recently applied for and was granted a CPP disability benefits.

Morgan recently applied for and was granted CPP disability benefits.\nScenario\nOn the application, Morgan stated that Madison, age 10, was in the custody and control of Madison's other parent. However, there is continuing contact between Morgan and Madison. Morgan gave consent to Service Canada to contact and tell Marley, the other parent, that Madison is entitled to the disabled contributor's children's benefit.\nOutcome\nBecause there is continuing contact between Morgan and Madison, Morgan must complete the Application for Benefits for under Age 18 Children of Disabled Contributor (ISP1152) to receive the benefit on Madison's behalf.\n3. Transition from under 18 years of age to over 18 years of age - Disabled contributor's child's benefit\nWho\nSushila has a parent who is receiving CPP disability benefits.

You may be asked to provide medical information about a patient of yours who has submitted an application for CPP disability benefits. The medical information that you provide will enable Service Canada to assess your patient's eligibility or continued eligibility.\nWe may also seek information from specialists or obtain a second opinion from an independent medical examiner.\nCPP disability benefits provide partial earnings replacement in the form of monthly payments to Canada Pension Plan contributors who have made the required contributions and are deemed regularly unable to work at any substantially gainful occupation due to a severe and prolonged mental or physical disability.\nCPP disability benefits:\ndo not provide additional payments for prescription drugs, medical supplies, assistive devices or other health-related services\nare not intended for short-term disability coverage, and\nautomatically convert to a CPP retirement pension at age 65\nWorking with your patient\nThe medical information you submit about your patient's capacity to work in any substantially gainful occupation is essential, not only for the initial application, but also during appeals, reassessments or vocational rehabilitation.\nNote\nSubstantially gainful work or occupation is considered to be any profession or work a person might do to earn a living. If the total annual amount of earnings from this work is more than 12 times the maximum monthly CPP disability pension amount, the work is considered to be substantially gainful.\nService Canada needs enough information to be satisfied that your patient meets the eligibility requirements for CPP disability benefits.\nWhat we need from you is a clear and comprehensive assessment of your patient's medical condition, together with information about any limitations on their capacity to function.\nYou can help your patient by submitting the medical report promptly.\nNote\nWe cannot make a decision to grant a disability benefit until we receive your report.\nPatient eligibility\nTo be eligible for CPP disability benefits, the applicant must:\nhave a mental or physical impairment that is both severe and prolonged\nbe under the age of 65, and\nmeet the CPP contribution requirements\nEligibility is determined on the basis of other factors in addition to the medical diagnosis. Our medical adjudicators consider the individual's circumstances, including:\nthe nature and severity of their medical condition\nthe impact of the medical condition and treatment on their capacity to work\ntheir prognosis\ntheir personal characteristics such as age, education, language proficiency and work experience\ntheir work performance and productivity, and\nvolunteer and educational activities\nMedical adjudicators do not consider the availability of suitable employment in the applicant's region when determining eligibility for CPP disability benefits.\nFor more information on eligibility criteria, consult section 1.\nApplication forms\nThe Application Kit for CPP Disability Benefits (ISP1151) is available online or by contacting Service Canada. Service Canada\u2019s contact information can be found in section 8.\nThe application kit includes:\nan Application for a Canada Pension Plan Disability Benefit (ISP1151) \u2013 to be completed by the applicant\na Medical Report for a Canada Pension Plan Disability Benefit (ISP2519) \u2013 sections 3 to 9 to be completed by the applicant's physician or nurse practitioner\nYou must complete the medical report on behalf of your patient.\nThe medical information you provide is critical to our assessment of an application.\nNote\nIf you diagnose your patient with a terminal illness, you are responsible for either:\ncompleting section 3 of the Terminal Illness Application for a Disability Benefit under the Canada Pension Plan (ISP2530B), or\ncompleting sections 3 to 9 of the Medical Report for a Canada Pension Plan Disability Benefit (ISP2519) and indicating the illness is terminal in section 4\nThe application will be processed within 5 business days for the terminally ill and within 30 calendar days for the gravely ill.\nType of medical information needed\nThe following information related to an applicant's medical history is required for the medical report:\nthe medical diagnosis of the mental or physical illness affecting the client's ability to work\nthe findings upon which the diagnosis was made\nthe resulting mental or physical functional limitations or restrictions\nthe date of onset of the limitations or restrictions\nthe prognosis of the medical condition\nthe impacts of treatment, and\nwhether the applicant's medical condition is recurrent or episodic, continuous, resolving, or unknown\nWe do not need your patient's entire medical file. Provide only the medical information relevant to your patient's capacity to work, including supporting documents such as:\nconsultants' reports\ndiagnostic test results\ninvestigative reports\nhospital notes\nIf your patient is regularly capable of working, they are unlikely to be eligible for CPP disability benefits.\nIf your clinical notes address all the questions in the medical report, you may send those notes instead of completing the entire medical report (which will have been sent to you to fill out). However, you must complete sections 5 and 9 of the report and sign the form.\nWe ask that you address the impairment(s) and associated functional limitations (physical, cognitive, emotional/behavioural) of the medical condition on your patient's capacity to work.\nPlease provide supporting documents for your comments as this will greatly assist us in making a decision.\nIn the case of a late application, we may ask you for information going back a number of years in order to determine when the application met the contributory requirements. With the appropriate information, we can treat an application as though it had been submitted at an earlier date, if the applicant was disabled when they last met the contributory requirements.\nWe must determine whether your patient can be considered to have been medically eligible from that date, continuously, to the present time.\nContact Service Canada if you are not able to provide the medical information requested. This will help prevent delays in determining your patient's eligibility.\nWe may be able to get information from your patient or from other sources, or we may decide to send your patient for an independent medical consultation.\nMedical information for continuing eligibility\nYou are very important in helping us determine whether your patient should continue to receive a disability benefit, or whether they might be eligible for the CPP Disability Vocational Rehabilitation Program.\nWe periodically review a beneficiary's case to ensure continuing eligibility, and we may ask you for up-to-date medical information on your patient's condition. If so, you may be asked to complete a short medical report.\nOur periodic reviews give us an opportunity to make contact with clients and identify what services would suit them best. If your patient's case is being reviewed, your patient will also be asked to provide medical and non-medical information.\nBecause everyone's medical condition is unique, each case is looked at individually. Once all the necessary information has been collected, a decision to continue or stop disability benefits is made.\nNote\nTo avoid delays for your patient, please answer all the questions on any forms you are asked to fill out and send it back to Service Canada as soon as possible.\nOther information\nWhile medical information is of primary importance, the CPP disability program takes a holistic approach to decision-making.\nFor example, some factors considered are:\nage\neducation\nlanguage proficiency\ntransferable work skills\nexperience\nNote\nLocal socio-economic conditions are not considered.\nApplicants and beneficiaries who are deemed ineligible for benefits may request a reconsideration of the initial decision to deny or discontinue a benefit. If the applicant is not satisfied with the reconsideration decision, they may appeal to the Social Security Tribunal.\nBilling\nYou must mail your invoice to the Service Canada office address indicated on the medical form.\nYou will be paid by cheque and payment will be mailed to the address you provide on the invoice.\nYour invoice must include:\nyour patient's name\nyour patient's address, and date of birth or Social Insurance Number, and\nyour business number, GST/HST number or Social Insurance Number\nService Canada will pay up to the following amounts\nTable 3: Medical forms to fill out for insurance\nForm title\nAmount\nInitial Medical Report for a Canada Pension Plan Disability Benefit (ISP2519)\n$85\nTerminal Illness Medical Attestation for a Disability Benefit Under the Canada Pension Plan (ISP2530B)\n$85\nReinstatement of CPP Disability Benefits, Physician Confirmation Form\n$20\nIf Service Canada ask for other information, including a narrative, and depending on the complexity and the time required for completion.\n$150\nYour patient is responsible for covering any extra costs.

You are entitled to claim regular benefits, as well as maternity, parental, sickness, compassionate care and family caregiver benefits.\nEligibility details\nThe regular eligibility period during which you can claim EI parental benefits starts during the week of birth for a newborn, or the week a child is placed with you for adoption. This period continues for the 52 weeks that follow in the case of standard parental benefits, or for the 78 weeks that follow in the case of extended parental benefits.\nYou can claim up to 35 weeks of EI standard parental benefits within this 52-week eligibility period, or 61 weeks of extended parental benefits, within this 78-week eligibility period. An extra 5 weeks of standard, or 8 weeks of extended, parental benefits is available if you share benefits with the other parent(s). One parent cannot take more than 35 weeks of standard or 61 weeks of extended parental benefits.\nTo provide more flexibility for Canadian Forces members, either of these EI parental benefit eligibility periods can be extended up to a maximum of 104 weeks.\nThis extension is available to Canadian Forces members who cannot collect all their parental benefits during the regular eligibility period because of an imperative military requirement as confirmed by the Department of National Defence. The imperative military requirement can either defer or interrupt their parental leave.\nExamples\nPaul, a Canadian Forces member, is entitled to 61 weeks of EI extended parental benefits after the birth of his daughter. After 15 weeks of parental leave, however, Paul is recalled to duty because of an imperative military requirement, which lasts 20 weeks. If he had not been recalled to duty, he would have been entitled to receive EI extended parental benefits for those 20 weeks. Paul's eligibility period for EI parental benefits can be extended by the full 20 weeks after he returns from the imperative military requirement\nKyana is a Canadian Forces member who adopted a child on September 8, 2016. She requested 37 weeks of parental leave from the Department of National Defence, starting on December 4, 2016. However, on November 6, 2016, she had to leave for a mission on an imperative military requirement. As a result, she could not start her parental leave as planned. Her leave was deferred until the date that she returned, which was March 25, 2017. If Kyana's parental leave had not been deferred, she would have been entitled to EI standard parental benefits for those 16 weeks. Kyana's eligibility period for EI standard parental benefits can be extended by the full 16 weeks after she returns from the imperative military requirement\nOther conditions you have to meet to take advantage of the extended eligibility period for EI parental benefits\nAs a Canadian Forces member, you have to:\nformally request your EI parental leave from the Department of National Defence before you leave for the imperative military requirement, or\nprovide the dates you intended to take your EI parental leave, if you are already on the imperative military requirement\nWhat you need before you start\nWhen an imperative military requirement either defers or interrupts your EI parental leave, the Department of National Defence will complete a form called \"PATA Extension \u2013 Imperative Military Requirement\" and will give you a copy of the completed form.\nTo complete the online EI application, you will need the following personal information:\nyour social insurance number (SIN)\nif your SIN begins with a 9, you will need to provide proof of your immigration status and work permit\nthe last name at birth of one of your parents\nyour mailing and residential addresses, including the postal codes\u2014if you do not have a usual place of residence, you must apply in person at your local Service Canada Centre and\nyour complete banking information to sign up for direct deposit, including:\nyour financial institution name\nyour bank branch number\nyour account number\nWhen you apply for EI parental benefits, you must provide:\nthe date of birth of your newborn or, in the case of an adoption, the date on which your child was placed with you (you must also provide the full name and address of the agency handling the adoption)\nthe SIN of the other parent, if you plan to share the benefits\nAfter you apply\nAfter you apply for EI parental benefits, you must then contact Service Canada at 1 800 206 7218 to provide the information contained in the completed PATA Extension\u2014Imperative Military Requirement form.\nCanadian Forces members living in Quebec\nCanadian Forces members residing in Quebec will continue to collect parental benefits from the existing Quebec Parental Insurance Plan.

There was a bit of a change in how the industry perceived it. There was a bit of a separation between the funeral industry and the family support industry and that changed for me because it meant my position really wasn't required. I really had to just go about developing a business model that let me find different ways to find clients. There is definitely a moment of fear when you find out that you have really been left to sort of fend for yourself. How am I going to pay my bills? Have I got enough savings to get me through this? I wasn't aware of the CWB program at all until I discovered it when I was doing income taxes for the year, did a quick little bit of research, found out exactly that I was who it was for. It's a great benefit to get someone through a difficult financial time. I was completely eligible and it was really very simple. It's done right on the tax return. I think the fact that there is an advance payment opportunity with the Canada workers benefit may make the program even more beneficial to some people.\n[text on screen]: Every dollar counts.\n[text on screen]: Find out if you qualify for the Canada workers benefit at\ncanada.ca/canada-workers-benefit\nReport a problem or mistake on this page\nPlease select all that apply:\nA link, button or video is not working\nIt has a spelling mistake\nInformation is missing\nInformation is outdated or wrong\nLogin error when trying to access an account\nI can't find what I'm looking for\nOther issue not in this list\nSubmit\nThank you for your help!\nYou will not receive a reply.

The earliest start date of the qualifying period is the week of March 1 for summer fishing or September 1 for winter fishing.\nThis is how we calculate your weekly benefit:\nwe calculate your total self-employment earnings from fishing during your qualifying period\u2014the last 31 weeks or from the start date of your last claim for EI benefits (we use the total earnings from the shorter period)\nwe determine the unemployment rate in your region and select the divisor that applies at that unemployment rate (see Table 1)\nwe divide your total self-employment earnings from fishing during your qualifying period by the applicable divisor. This gives us your weekly insurable earnings from self-employment in fishing\nif you have earnings from employment other than as a self-employed fisher, we calculate your total earnings from the last 26 weeks of that other employment, using only the weeks contained in the fishing qualifying period. We divide this amount by the applicable divisor or by the number of weeks worked, whichever is greater. This gives us your weekly insurable earnings from regular employment\nwe add the results from Steps 3 and 4 together to find your total weekly insurable earnings\nwe compare your total weekly insurable earnings with the allowed maximum weekly amount, and we select the lower figure. The maximum weekly amount can vary from year to year and is based on the maximum insurable earnings for the calendar year\nwe multiply that lower figure by 55% to obtain the amount of your weekly benefit\nTable 1 \u2013 Divisors used to calculate benefits\nRegional rate of unemployment\nMinimum divisor\n6% or less\n22\n6.1% to 7%\n21\n7.1% to 8%\n20\n8.1% to 9%\n19\n9.1% to 10%\n18\n10.1% to 11%\n17\n11.1% to 12%\n16\n12.1% to 13%\n15\n13.1% or more\n14\nExample 1\nIn 2023, John earns $9,865 from self-employment in fishing during his qualifying period of 31 weeks. The unemployment rate in his area is 11.5%, which means the divisor is 16. Dividing his fishing earnings of $9,865 by 16 gives him weekly insurable earnings of $616.56. This amount is lower than the maximum weekly amount, which is $1,182.69 in 2023. His weekly benefit rate is therefore $339 [($9,865 \u00f7 16) x 55%].\nExample 2\nIn 2023, John earns $9,865 from self-employment in fishing during his qualifying period of 31 weeks. The unemployment rate in his area is 11.5%, which means the divisor is 16. Dividing his fishing earnings of $9,865 by 16 gives him weekly insurable earnings of $616.56.\nHowever, within the last 26 weeks (which occurred in the 31-week qualifying period), John also works in another job during which he earns $10,000 in 15 weeks. Because these earnings aren't from self-employment in fishing, they're called regular\u00a0earnings. The unemployment rate in his area is 11.5%, which means the divisor is 16. Dividing his regular earnings of $10,000 by 16 gives him weekly insurable earnings of $625.00. We use the divisor of 16 for the regular earnings because it is greater than 15, which is the number of regular weeks of insurable earnings in the last 26 weeks.\nWe calculate John's total weekly insurable earnings as follows:\nfishing weekly earnings: $616.56\nregular weekly earnings: $625.00\ntotal weekly earnings: $1,241.56\nWhen the regular earnings are added to the fishing earnings, the total is greater than the maximum weekly amount of $1,182.69 per week. Since John's insurable earnings can't exceed the maximum weekly amount for 2023, we use that amount to calculate his benefit rate. John's weekly benefit rate is therefore $650 [($61,500 \u00f7 52 weeks) x 55%].\nNote\nThe maximum weekly amount is based on the yearly maximum insurable earnings amount. In 2023, the yearly maximum insurable earnings amount is $61,500. The maximum weekly amount for 2023 is calculated by dividing $61,500 by 52 weeks. This means the maximum weekly amount for 2023 is $1,182.69.\nFamily supplement\nIf your net family income doesn't exceed $25,921 per year, you have children and you or your spouse receive the Canada Child Tax Benefit, you're considered a member of a low-income family. Therefore, you may be eligible to receive the EI family supplement.\nThe family supplement rate is based on your net family income up to a maximum of $25,921 per year and the number of children in the family and their ages.\nThe family supplement may increase your benefit rate up to 80% of your average insurable earnings. If you and your spouse claim EI benefits at the same time,\u00a0only one of you\u00a0can receive the family supplement. It is generally better for\u00a0the spouse with the lower benefit rate\u00a0to receive the supplement.\nIf your income increases, the family supplement will gradually decrease. If you go over the maximum income of $25,921, you'll no longer receive the supplement.\nTaxable EI benefits\nEI benefits are taxable, no matter what type of benefits you receive. Federal and provincial or territorial taxes, where applicable, will therefore be deducted from your payment.\nBenefit duration\nIf you qualify for fishing benefits, you may receive up to 26 weeks of benefits within a period of 37 or 38 weeks, depending on the day of the week on which April 1 or October 1 falls. This period is called the benefit period.\nBenefit period\nThe benefit period for a\u00a0winter claim\u00a0can start as early as the week of April 1 and must end no later than the week of December 15.\nThe benefit period for a\u00a0summer claim\u00a0can start as early as the week of October 1 and must end no later than the week of June 15.\nThe benefit period can be extended to a maximum of 52 weeks if you're claiming EI special benefits such as sickness benefits. The benefit period is extended by one week for each week of special benefits claimed.\nDocument navigation\nPrevious: Do you qualify\nNext: Apply\nReport a problem or mistake on this page\nPlease select all that apply:\nA link, button or video is not working\nIt has a spelling mistake\nInformation is missing\nInformation is outdated or wrong\nLogin error when trying to access an account\nI can't find what I'm looking for\nOther issue not in this list\nSubmit\nThank you for your help!\nYou will not receive a reply.

If you\u2019re not eligible, we\u2019ll notify you of the decision made about your application.\nWaiting period\nBefore you start receiving Employment Insurance (EI) benefits, there is 1 week for which you won\u2019t be paid. This is called the waiting period. It\u2019s like the deductible that you must pay for other types of insurance.\nAny money you earn during the 1-week waiting period will be deducted from your benefit payment during the first 3 weeks for which benefits are paid. Once these 3 weeks have passed, the waiting period has no further effect on your benefits.\nTo receive your payment, you must complete an EI report (online or by telephone) every 2 weeks. You can\u2019t receive your payment unless you complete these reports.\nAccess code\nOnce your application is received, we'll mail you a benefit statement with a 4-digit access code. You\u2019ll need this code and your social insurance number (SIN) to follow up on your application. Receiving an EI benefit statement doesn't mean that we've made a decision about your claim.\nTo find out more about the fishing benefit, please read the Fishers and Employment Insurance guide, contact your nearest Service Canada office or call our EI Telephone Information Service at 1-800-206-7218 for service in English; 1-800-808-6352 for service in French (TTY: 1-800-529-3742).\nIf you disagree with the decision about your application for EI benefits\nYou can request a reconsideration of the decision. You must submit a request for reconsideration within 30 days after the day the decision was communicated to you. You can contact Service Canada to help you with your reconsideration request.\nWhile on EI\nYou can\u2019t work full time and receive EI benefits. However, you can work part time while receiving benefits.\nYou\u2019ll be able to keep 50 cents of your EI benefits for every dollar you earn, up to 90% of the weekly insurable earnings used to calculate your EI benefit amount, if you work while receiving fishing benefits and have served your waiting period. If you earn any money above this 90%, we\u2019ll deduct it dollar for dollar from your benefits.\nFor more information, visit the\u00a0Working While on Claim page.\nYou must report all gross earnings\u2014that is, earnings before taxes and deductions\u2014during the week you earn them, as well as any other money you receive while collecting fishing benefits.\nReceiving fishing and other types of EI benefits in the same claim period\nUnder certain conditions, you may receive fishing benefits and maternity, parental, sickness and/or family caregiver benefits during the same claim period. In this case, the benefit period would be extended to a maximum of 52 weeks, and you could receive up to 50 weeks of benefits.\nThe only exception is when EI fishing benefits and extended parental benefits are paid. As extended parental benefits are paid at a benefit rate of 33% of your weekly insurable earnings, up to a maximum amount, once 50 weeks of benefits have been paid, the weeks of extended parental benefits will be converted to an equivalent number of weeks that would have been paid at the 55% benefit rate. This conversion will determine how many more weeks of fishing benefits and special benefits can be paid to reach the equivalent of 50 weeks paid at the 55% benefits rate. Any weeks where you return to work during this period will be considered weeks paid for the purposes of calculating the equivalent of 50 weeks paid at the 55% benefit rate. Once the number of additional weeks that can be paid is determined, the benefit period will be extended to allow for the additional weeks to be paid.\nIt is important to note that if you haven\u2019t been paid any fishing or regular benefits during your benefit period, you may be able to receive up to 102 weeks of maternity, parental, sickness and/or family caregiver benefits in the same benefit period.\nTo find out whether you\u2019re eligible to receive other types of EI benefits in the same benefit period, please call our EI Telephone Information Service at 1-800-206-7218 (TTY: 1-800-529-3742) between 8:30 am and 4:30 pm, Monday to Friday. You can also write to us or go in person to your Service Canada Centre.\nTravelling outside Canada\nUsually, you can\u2019t receive EI benefits while outside Canada. One measure we take to enforce this rule is to compare EI information with information from the Canada Border Services Agency. If we find you have been out of the country while collecting fishing benefits, we will try to determine whether you are entitled to those benefits. If not, we will calculate your overpayment, which you will then have to repay.\nWe may also impose penalties of up to 3 times your weekly benefit rate or 3 times the amount of your overpayment. As well, you may have to earn more to qualify for fishing benefits in the future.\nRepaying benefits at income tax time\nWhen you file your income tax return, you may be required to repay some of the EI benefits you received. This will depend on your net income and whether you were paid EI regular non-fishing or regular fishing benefits during the tax year.\nFor more information, visit the EI and overpayments page or call our EI Telephone Information Service at 1-800-206-7218 (TTY: 1-800-529-3742). You can also write to us or visit us in person at a Service Canada Centre.\nProtecting Employment Insurance\nWe work to protect the EI program from misuse. One of the ways we do this is by working with employers and claimants to ensure the accuracy of the information we receive. With your help, we can reduce the amount of misuse and ensure that the EI program is used as it should be\u2014as a program that provides temporary financial assistance to individuals who qualify.\nA mistake is an unintentional act. We know claimants can make mistakes when filing their reports. Common mistakes include:\nestimating weekly earnings instead of putting in the actual amount earned\nforgetting to declare all the earnings received\nwriting or entering the wrong number when reporting earnings, or\nadding the number of hours or amount of earnings incorrectly\nSome mistakes can delay benefit payments, while others can affect the amount of benefits you receive\u2014meaning you were paid more or less than you were entitled to receive.\nFor example, estimating your earnings can have the following effects:\nif you estimated your earnings for 1 week and your estimate was higher than the earnings you actually received, your benefit amount will be less than it should have been. If this happens, let us know and we will adjust your file to make sure you receive all the benefits to which you are entitled, or\nif you estimated your earnings for 1 week and your estimate was lower than the earnings you actually received, your benefit amount will be higher than it should have been. Let us know if this happens. You\u2019ll have to repay the excess amount, but we\u2019ll ensure that repaying it causes no undue hardship. As well, we\u2019ll adjust your file to reflect your accurate information\nIf you notice a mistake on a completed form or report, or if there is a change in your circumstances that could affect your EI claim, tell Service Canada immediately. This will help prevent any future problems with your claim.\nMisrepresentation\nIf you knowingly withhold information, make misleading statements, or misrepresent the facts to make a false claim for benefits, this is considered misrepresentation. You could face severe monetary penalties or prosecution. This could also affect your future benefits. However, if you disclose your actions to Service Canada before an investigation begins, we may waive any monetary penalties and prosecutions that might otherwise apply.\nConsequences of misrepresentation: Interest and penalties\nInterest on debt\nWhen EI claimants receive benefits to which they\u2019re not entitled, the amount of the overpayment counts as a debt that must be repaid.\nWe charge interest on this debt when it results from claimants who knowingly withhold information or make false or misleading representations or statements. However, we do not charge interest on debt that results when we make an error in the benefit payment.\nThe rate of interest is the Bank of Canada average rate plus 3%. Interest is calculated daily and compounded monthly.\nPenalties\nA penalty may be imposed on a claimant, an employer, or an individual acting on their behalf in relation to a claim for benefits when he or she has:\nknowingly made false or misleading representations or statements, or\ncompleted a statement without declaring essential information\nHere is an example of a situation where penalties may be imposed:\nAn EI benefit claimant goes on an ocean cruise for a month and arranges for a friend to conceal their absence by signing and returning 2 EI claimant reports. As a result, the claimant illegally received $350 in benefits for each of the 4 weeks of the cruise. After investigation, we find that this was the first time the claimant and the friend had misused the EI system. As well, we find that they both knew that what they did was illegal but they did it anyway.\nIn this case, the claimant will have to repay $1,400 (4 weeks of benefits at $350 per week) and may have to pay a penalty of $700 ($350 for each of the 2 false reports filed during the holiday). The friend may also have to pay a penalty of $700 for the illegal act of filing 2 false reports on behalf of the claimant.\nThere are many situations when a penalty may apply, and the amount could become very high. Depending on the circumstances, the maximum penalty could be up to 3 times the amount of the overpayment, 3 times the weekly benefit rate for each incident of misrepresentation, or 3 times the maximum benefit rate.\nViolations\nClaimants who misuse the EI program and were assessed a violation may need more insurable earnings or hours to qualify for benefits in the future. The required amount rises based on the number and seriousness of misrepresentations that have been recorded in the 5-year period before the start of their claims.\nRights and responsibilities\nThe EI program guarantees certain rights. There are also some basic responsibilities, for both you and Service Canada.\nWhen you apply for EI benefits, you must:\nbe capable of and available for work and unable to obtain suitable employment\nactively search for and accept offers of suitable employment\nconduct job search activities that increase your opportunities to find suitable employment, such as:\nassessing employment opportunities\npreparing a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or cover letter\nregistering for job search tools or with electronic job banks or employment agencies\nattending job search workshops or job fairs\nnetworking\ncontacting prospective employers\nsubmitting job applications\nattending interviews\nundergoing evaluations of competencies\nkeep a detailed record as proof of your job search efforts to find suitable employment as we may ask you to provide that proof at any time.

It is intended for Canada Pension Plan (CPP) retirement pension beneficiaries found to be disabled but not eligible for a disability pension due to being CPP retirement pension beneficiaries for more than 15 months. Applicants who have made sufficient contributions may be eligible for this benefit in addition to their retirement pension.\nStep 2 Eligibility\nThe eligibility criteria are the same as for the Canada Pension Plan disability pension. You must:\nbe under the age of 65\nhave a severe and prolonged mental or physical medical condition, according to the definition in the Canada Pension Plan legislation\nmeet the minimum contributory requirements\nTo meet the minimum contributory requirements, you must:\nhave made valid contributions to the CPP in 4 of the last 6 years\nhave contributed for at least 25 years, including 3 of the last 6 years\nmeet the requirements for the late applicant provision\nIf you apply for CPP disability benefits but are not eligible because you have received the CPP retirement pension for more than 15 months, we will automatically consider your eligibility for the post-retirement disability benefit.\nStep 3 How to apply\nThere is no separate application for this benefit. You will have to complete a CPP disability benefits application.\nStep 4 How much you could receive\nThe amount of the Post-Retirement Disability Benefit is the flat rate component of the disability pension. For the current year the amount is $558.74 (2023).\nThis amount will be paid until age 65, at which point the PRDB payment stops and the person continues to receive the retirement pension.\nStep 5 How does the Post-Retirement Disability Benefit interact with your other benefits\nThe Post-Retirement Disability Benefit is paid in addition to the CPP retirement pension you are receiving, until the age of 65.\nIf you have any dependent children, a disabled contributor's child benefit is payable.\nCPP benefits may affect the income you receive from other programs. Some income-tested benefits take your CPP income into account, such as the War Veterans Allowance, Employment Insurance, the Guaranteed Income Supplement, the Allowance and the Allowance for the Survivor, as well as provincial and territorial social assistance (\"welfare\") and disability benefits and most workers' compensation programs. CPP benefits may also affect how much you get from your employer pension or private-sector disability insurance.\nReport a problem or mistake on this page\nPlease select all that apply:\nA link, button or video is not working\nIt has a spelling mistake\nInformation is missing\nInformation is outdated or wrong\nLogin error when trying to access an account\nI can't find what I'm looking for\nOther issue not in this list\nSubmit\nThank you for your help!\nYou will not receive a reply.

You have 2 years from the date your CPP disability benefits stopped to make a request for reinstatement.\nIf your children are still eligible, their children's benefits will also be reinstated.\nHow does it work\nYour disability benefits can be quickly reinstated if you self reported your return to work or your volunteer and/or educational activities, and:\nyour benefits stopped less than 2 years ago because you returned to work or because of your volunteer and/or educational activities\nyou cannot continue working because the same or related disability has recurred\nyou are under the age of 65\nyou are not receiving the CPP retirement pension\nThere may be times when you can work on a regular basis, followed by periods when you cannot work because of your disability. There is no limit to how many times you can ask for your benefits to be reinstated.\nExamples\nMarie contacts Service Canada to say she recently returned to work. Her benefits are stopped in March 2013 after a successful 3-month work trial. Unfortunately, her medical condition worsens, and in January 2014 she can no longer continue working.\nThe following timelines apply to Marie's situation:\nMarch 2013: benefits are stopped because Marie reports that she has returned to working regularly\nMarch 2015: latest date Marie is entitled to automatic reinstatement of benefits (2 years from the date her benefits were stopped)\nJanuary 2014: Marie stops working because of a recurrence of her disability\nJanuary 2015: deadline to request reinstatement of her benefits (1 year from the month she stopped working)\nJuanita contacts Service Canada to report her volunteer activity of 30 hours per week for more than 4 months. It was determined that her volunteer activity showed that she was capable of pursuing substantially gainful work. Her benefits were stopped as a result.\nUnfortunately, her medical condition worsens, and one year later she can no longer continue with her work activity.\nJuanita may be eligible to have her CPP disability benefits automatically reinstated:\nher benefits were stopped because she self reported that she was participating in volunteer activity\nshe is within 2 years of the date her benefits were stopped\nshe is unable to continue her work activity because of a recurrence of her disability\nshe is within 1 year of the deadline to request reinstatement of her benefits (1 year from the month her work activity stopped)\nHow to request an automatic reinstatement\nYou have up to 1 year from the month you stopped working, volunteering or going to school because of your disability to make your request.\nTwo forms need to be completed and sent to us:\nyou must fill out a form confirming that you cannot continue working because your disability has recurred, and asking to have your benefits reinstated\nyour doctor or nurse practitioner must fill out a form confirming that your disability has recurred\nWe will mail the forms to you when your benefits stop.\nWhen payments start\nYour CPP disability benefits are reinstated starting the month after you become unable to work due to your disability.\nBenefit amount\nThe amount of your CPP disability benefits will not be less than the amount you were receiving before your benefits stopped. It will reflect all automatic annual increases and any increases due to additional CPP contributions you made while working. If your family situation has changed, your benefits may increase or decrease, depending on your circumstances.\nRead more about the CPPD benefit amounts.\nIf you disagree with the decision\nYou may request a reconsideration of the decision that was made regarding your automatic reinstatement.\nIf you work more than 2 years and your disability recurs\nIf you have worked longer than 2 years and your disability recurs, you may be eligible for a fast-track reapplication \u2014 a simpler and faster process than filing a new application. Fast-track reapplication is available for up to 5 years after your benefits stopped. You must meet the same eligibility conditions for a fast-track reapplication as for a regular disability benefit. Contact the Canada Pension Plan for more information or to request a fast-track reapplication form.\nRelated links\nCanada Pension Plan Disability\nCPP Disability Vocational Rehabilitation Program\nCanada Pension Plan disability toolkit\nCPP legislation\nSection 28 of the Privacy Act\nReport a problem or mistake on this page\nPlease select all that apply:\nA link, button or video is not working\nIt has a spelling mistake\nInformation is missing\nInformation is outdated or wrong\nLogin error when trying to access an account\nI can't find what I'm looking for\nOther issue not in this list\nSubmit\nThank you for your help!\nYou will not receive a reply.

The tax rate is 25% unless reduced or exempted by a tax treaty between Canada and your country of residence. The non-resident tax will be deducted from your benefit payments.\nRequesting a reduction in the amount of non-resident tax withheld (form NR5)\nIf you live in a country with a tax treaty with Canada, you don't need to ask for taxes on your payments to be reduced or exempted. It will be done automatically when you file your income tax.\nIf you live in a country without a tax treaty or if you want less tax to be withheld from your monthly payments, you may ask for your taxes to be reduced or eliminated from your benefit payment by completing the Application by a Non-Resident of Canada for a Reduction in the Amount of Non-Resident Tax Required to be Withheld (NR5) . The NR5 should be received by October 31 if you want less tax to be withheld in the following year starting in January. If late, your application cannot be accepted. Once approved, the NR5 is valid for five years unless your income changes. Note, however, that you must still file an income tax return each taxation year. Also, if you already have an NR5 for one pension and you start to receive a second pension, you must complete a new NR5.\nOAS recovery tax\nIf your annual income is higher than the net world threshold, for example $72,809 for the 2015 tax year, you may be subject to the Old Age Security \"recovery tax\", and you may have to repay part or all of your OAS pension.\nThe Canada Revenue Agency tells Service Canada how much tax to withhold from your OAS benefit based on the Old Age Security Return of Income (OASRI) you filed. The recovery tax plus the non-resident tax withheld cannot be more than the amount of the OAS benefits received in the year. You will receive an advisory letter from Service Canada before July 1, showing you the recovery tax deductions, if any, that are being withheld from your OAS pension payments.\nIf you reside in a country that has a tax treaty with Canada, you may be exempt from paying the recovery tax.\nFiling your taxes\nAs a non-resident pensioner who receives OAS payments, unless you resided in one of these countries in 2014, you must submit an Old Age Security Return of Income (OASRI) before April 30th so that the Canada Revenue Agency can determine if you have to pay the recovery tax. This will also ensure that your OAS payments are not interrupted. The recovery tax is calculated using the net world income that you report on this return.\nIf you are a resident of a country with which Canada has a tax treaty, you may not have to file this return. For more information on this exception, see the list of tax treaty countries.\nNR4 tax information slips\nEarly each year, if you are living outside Canada, you will receive a NR4 tax information slip showing the amount of CPP or OAS payments you received during the previous year. You must include this slip when you file your annual income tax return.\nYou can view your NR4 tax information slips online as early as February 1.\nIf you have not signed up to view them online, we will send your CPP or OAS tax information slips by mail, in February. If you do not receive your tax slips by February 28, contact International Social Security Agreements.\nMore tax information\nSee the Canada Revenue Agency web site for \"Non-Resident Seniors\" for other useful tax information for non-residents. If you have tax-related questions, you can also contact a Canada Revenue Agency International Tax Services Office.\nHow are my foreign benefits taxed if I live in Canada?\nSee the Canada Revenue Agency web page on \"Pensions from a Foreign Country\" for taxation information.\nNon-Resident Tax Rates by Country\nIf you live outside Canada, a non-resident tax is withheld from your monthly Old Age Security (OAS) and Canada Pension Plan (CPP) or Quebec Pension Plan (QPP) payments.\nThe standard non-resident tax rate is 25%. However, Canada has tax treaties with some countries that affect the amount of non-resident tax withheld.\nThis table shows the tax rate that applies to your country of residence as well as any applicable exemption.\nNon-Resident Tax Rates by Country\nCountry of residence\nOAS benefits\nCPP or QPP pensions\nCPP or QPP death benefits\nApplicable exemptions\nArgentina\n15%\n15%\n25%\nAustralia\n15%\n15%\n15%\nAzerba\u00efjan\n15%\n15%\n25%\nYou are exempt from tax on the first CAN $12,000 (or its equivalent in the country's currency) of the total of your pensions from Canada (except for CPP or QPP death benefits).

The PRB cannot be divided with a former spouse (credit splitting) or shared with a current spouse (pension sharing).\nWhat are my contributions to CPP?\nContributions toward the CPP are made at the same rates as all CPP contributions:\nEmployees contribute 4.95% of their pensionable earnings\nEmployers contribute 4.95% of the employee's pensionable earnings\nSelf-employed workers contribute both portions for a total of 9.9% of their net pensionable income.\nExample\nJane is a CPP retirement pension recipient who, in 2013, is 65 years of age.

It can also reduce or eliminate restrictions based on citizenship or on payment of pensions abroad.\nNote: Possible eligibility for more than one benefit\nYou may be eligible for a foreign pension, a Canadian pension, or both.\nCanadian benefits\nIf you have lived and/or worked in Canada and in another country, and do not meet the contributory\nor residence requirement for a Canada Pension Plan or Old Age Security benefit, a social security agreement may help you qualify. It might also provide benefits to your surviving spouse, common law partner or children.\nThe Canadian benefits included in Canada\u2019s international social security agreements are those paid under the Old Age Security program and the Canada Pension Plan program.\nA social security agreement may help you qualify for a Canadian or foreign benefit, or both, if you lived or worked abroad and in Canada.\nTo help you qualify for a Canadian pension or benefit:\nyour periods of contribution under the legislation of another country may be considered as periods of contribution to the Canada Pension Plan (CPP).\nyour periods of residency and contribution under the legislation of another country, also known as creditable periods, may be considered as periods of residency in Canada for the Old Age Security (OAS) program depending on the agreement.\nExample 1\nThomas, 65, lived in Austria for much of his life. He lived in Canada for 16 years after the age of 18. This year, he moved back to Austria to be nearer his aging parents. Normally 20 years of residence in Canada is needed to receive an OAS pension outside Canada, so Thomas would normally not have qualified. However, the social security agreement with Austria allows him to count the time he lived in Austria after age 18 towards meeting the 20 -year residence-in-Canada requirement. Thomas will receive a partial OAS pension outside Canada for the rest of his life.\nNote that while the social security agreement helped qualify Thomas to receive an OAS pension, the payment amount is determined by the numbers of years of residence in Canada after age 18. Having lived in Canada for 16 years, Thomas will receive 16/40ths of the full OAS pension.\nExample 2\nLiam was born in Ireland and worked there for 20 years before moving to Canada at the age of 40. Liam worked in Canada and contributed to the CPP for 5 years prior to his death at age 46. For Liam\u2019s spouse and child to be eligible for CPP death and survivor benefits, Liam needed to have contributed to the CPP for 10 years. (You have to contribute to the CPP for at least one-third of all the years of your \u201ccontributory period\u201d.) Because Liam contributed to the CPP for only 5 years, his survivors would normally not be entitled to death or survivor benefits. However, the social security agreement with Ireland allows his periods of contribution to the Irish pension program to be considered as periods of contribution to the CPP in order to satisfy the minimum qualifying period of 10 years. Since Liam\u2019s spouse and child meet the age requirements, they will be entitled to CPP death and survivor benefits.\nNote that, while the social security agreement helped Liam\u2019s spouse and child to qualify for CPP benefits, the payment amounts will be based on the actual contributions Liam made to the CPP.\nForeign benefits\nThe foreign benefits covered by Canada\u2019s international social security agreements vary from agreement to agreement. It is important to check the details of the agreement that relates to you.\nTo help you qualify for a foreign pension or benefit:\nyour periods of contribution to the Canada Pension Plan or periods of residence in Canada may be considered as periods of contribution or residence under a foreign social security program.\nExample 3\nChristine, from Winnipeg, lived in Canada until she was 30 when she accepted a job at an international engineering firm in Barbados. She worked there for 7 years and then decided to return to Canada. Because she did not contribute to the Barbadian social security scheme for the minimum period of time, she would normally not qualify for a Barbadian retirement pension. So her contributions to the Barbadian pension plan would have been lost. However, Canada\u2019s social security agreement with Barbados allows her to combine her periods of contribution to the Canada Pension Plan with her periods of contribution to the Barbadian social security scheme in order to meet the minimum requirement. Later, when she is ready to apply for her Barbadian pension, it will be based on those 7 years of contributions to the Barbadian social security scheme.\n(And, when she is ready to apply for her Canada Pension Plan retirement pension, it will be based on her years of contributions to the CPP. Her Canadian Old Age Security pension will be based on her years of residence in Canada after the age of 18.)\nDocument navigation\nPrevious - Overview\nNext - How much could you receive\nReport a problem or mistake on this page\nPlease select all that apply:\nA link, button or video is not working\nIt has a spelling mistake\nInformation is missing\nInformation is outdated or wrong\nLogin error when trying to access an account\nI can't find what I'm looking for\nOther issue not in this list\nSubmit\nThank you for your help!\nYou will not receive a reply.

The CRIC can also give you an idea of your other retirement income, including CPP and OAS benefit estimates.\nThe maximum PRB for one year is equal to 1/40th of the maximum CPP retirement pension. If you contribute less than the maximum, the amount of the year's PRB will be proportional to your contributions. For example, if you contributed half of the maximum contribution level, you will receive half of the maximum PRB.\nNote:\nWorking the same year you start receiving your CPP retirement pension.\nIf you work in the same year that your retirement pension begins, we will determine which portion of that year's contributions will go toward the retirement pension and which portion, if any, will go toward the PRB.\nCanada Pension Plan Post-Retirement Benefit - Born in 1944\nFrom the left-hand column, choose the annual earnings closest to the amount you expect to make in 2012.\nNote: This amount should be in gross dollars for employees and in net dollars for self-employed individuals.\nFollow that line across the table and select the column that corresponds most closely with the month of your birth. The amount in this column is the estimated amount of benefits you will receive from the PRB each year, beginning in 2013.\nNote: The benefit payments shown in the chart below are expressed in today\u2019s dollars, calculated using the 2011 maximum pension amount. Today's dollars allows you to make a meaningful comparison of your future retirement income and future expenses. Basically, it's as if you were to start your retirement pension today.

In fact, you could increase it by means of the CPP post-retirement benefit.\nIf you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension and are under age 70, you can still make CPP contributions. Each year you contribute to the CPP will result in a post-retirement benefit and increase your retirement income. We will automatically pay you this benefit the following year.

The entitlement conditions vary according to your age, length of time of insurance, and whether you are a man or a woman.\nIf you have not contributed to the program for the minimum period, to qualify for a Greek benefit under the Agreement, Greece will consider periods of contribution to the Canada Pension Plan and periods of residence in Canada after the age of 18 as periods credited under the Greek pension program.\nApply\nPrint and complete one of the following application forms:\nIf you live in Canada\nIf you live in Canada and want to apply for Canadian benefits, consult the Pensions in Canada.\nIf you live in Canada and want to apply for Greek benefits:\nGreece/Canada Agreement \u2013 Application for Greek Old Age/Invalidity Benefits (CAN-GR 1(OA-I))\nGreece/Canada Agreement \u2013 Application for Greek Survivor\u2019s Benefit (CAN-GR 1(SVR))\nAttach any necessary supporting documents, and return the application form to a Service Canada Centre, or mail it to:\nInternational Operations\nService Canada\nPO Box 2710 Station Main\nEdmonton AB\u00a0 T5J\u00a02G4\nCanada\nIf you live in Greece\nIf you live in Greece and want to apply for Canadian benefits:\nGreece/Canada Agreement - Application for Canadian Old Age, Retirement and Survivor Benefits (ISP5054-GRC)\nGreece/Canada Agreement - Application for CPP Child's Benefits (ISP5055-GRE)\nGreece/Canada Agreement - Application for CPP Disability Benefits (ISP5053-GRE)\nAttach any necessary supporting documents, and return the application form to a social security office in Greece, or mail it to:\nInternational Operations\nService Canada\nPO Box 2710 Station Main\nEdmonton AB\u00a0 T5J\u00a02G4\nCanada\nGreece's social security\nEFKA Unified Social Security Fund (in Greek only)\nAgricultural Insurance Organisation (OGA)\nResources\nAgreement on social security between Canada and the Hellenic Republic\nGeneral overview of Greece\u2019s social security system\nInformation on programs and services for Canadians living abroad\nInformation on contributing to the Canada Pension Plan while working abroad and contact information for the Canada Revenue Agency\u00a0(CRA)\nNote: The Agreement\nThis page contains general information on the Convention on Social Security between Canada and the Hellenic Republic and may not describe all the provisions that apply to your situation.

However, under the Agreement, the benefit paid by each country will be based solely on your creditable periods under that country\u2019s pension program. In other words, Canada will pay a benefit amount reflecting the portion of your periods that are creditable under Canada's pension program, and Denmark will pay a benefit amount reflecting the portion of your creditable periods under Denmark's pension program.\nEligibility\nCanadian benefits\nThe Canadian pension programs included in the Agreement are the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and the Old Age Security (OAS) program.\nIf you do not qualify for a Canada Pension Plan benefit based on your contributions to the CPP, Canada will consider periods of contribution to the pension program of Denmark as periods of contribution to the Canada Pension Plan.\nIf you do not qualify for an Old Age Security pension based on your years of residence in Canada, Canada will consider periods of residence in Denmark after March 31, 1957 and after the age of 18 as periods of residence in Canada.\nNote: Quebec Pension Plan (QPP) contributors\nThe Government of Canada's international social security agreements cover Old Age Security and Canada Pension Plan benefits only. If you contribute or have contributed to the QPP but not to the CPP, please consult the Quebec Pension Plan.\nDanish benefits\nThe pension program of Denmark consists of the Social Pensions Act and the Labour Market Supplementary Pension (ATP) Scheme.

If you contribute or have contributed to the QPP but not to the CPP, please consult the Quebec Pension Plan.\nCroatian benefits\nThe pension program of Croatia is similar to the Canada Pension Plan and covers most employed and self-employed persons in Croatia.\nTo qualify for a benefit under the pension program of Croatia, you normally must have contributed to the program for a minimum number of years.\nIf you have not contributed to the program for the minimum period, to qualify for a Croatian old age pension under the Agreement, Croatia will consider periods of contribution to the Canada Pension Plan and periods of residence in Canada after the age of 18 as credited periods under the pension program of Croatia. To determine eligibility for Croatian disability and survivor benefits, Croatia will consider periods of contribution to the Canada Pension Plan as periods of contribution to the Croatian pension program.\nApply\nPrint and complete one of the following application forms:\nIf you live in Canada\nIf you live in Canada and want to apply for Canadian benefits, consult the Pensions in Canada.\nIf you live in Canada and want to apply for Croatian benefits:\nCroatia/Canada Agreement - Application for a Croatian Old Age Benefit (CAN/HR 1)\nCroatia/Canada Agreement - Application for Croatian Survivors Benefits (CAN/HR 4)\nCroatia/Canada Agreement - Application for a Croatian Disability Benefit (CAN/HR 3)\nAttach any necessary supporting documents, and return the application form to a Service Canada Centre, or mail it to:\nInternational Operations\nService Canada\nPO Box 2710 Station Main\nEdmonton AB\u00a0 T5J 2G4\nCanada\nIf you live in Croatia\nIf you live in Croatia and want to apply for Canadian benefits:\nCroatia/Canada Agreement - Application for Canadian Old Age, Retirement and Survivors Benefits (ISP5054-HRV)\nCroatia/Canada Agreement - Application for CPP Disability Benefits (ISP5053-HRV)\nCroatia/Canada Agreement - Application for CPP Child's Benefits (ISP5055-HRV)\nAttach any necessary supporting documents, and return the application form to a social security office in Croatia, or mail it to:\nInternational Operations\nService Canada\nPO Box 2710 Station Main\nEdmonton AB\u00a0 T5J 2G4\nCanada\nCroatia's Social Security\nHrvatski Zavod za Mirovinsko Osiguranje [Croatian Pension Insurance Institute] (in Croatian only)\nResources\nAgreement on Social Security between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Republic of Croatia\nGeneral overview of Croatia\u2019s social security system\nInformation on programs and services for Canadians living abroad\nInformation on contributing to the Canada Pension Plan while working abroad and contact information for the Canada Revenue Agency\u00a0(CRA)\nNote: The Agreement\nThis page contains general information on the Agreement on Social Security between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Republic of Croatia and may not describe all the provisions that apply to your situation.

Also, keep a copy of your return and notice of assessment or reassessment.\nAfter you file your return\nNotice of assessment\nYou will receive a notice of assessment after the CRA processes your return. The notice gives you a summary of your assessment and explanations of any changes made to your return. The notice tells you if you have a refund, owe money, or have a zero balance. It also gives you\u00a0other important information, including but not limited to,\u00a0your unused registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) contributions, your RRSP deduction limit, your Canada training credit limit, and other amounts and balances that\u00a0you may want to carry forward to a future year.\nProcessing time\nThe CRA's goal is to send you a notice of assessment, as well as any refund, within eight weeks.\nNote\nThis timeline applies to returns that are received on or before the due date.\nWhen the CRA receives your return, it is usually processed and a notice of assessment is sent to you. However, each year, the CRA conducts a number of reviews to promote awareness of, and compliance with, the laws that the CRA administers.\nIf your return is selected for a more detailed review before or after it is assessed, you will receive a letter or a phone call from the CRA. It's important to know that a review is not a tax audit. In most cases, it's simply a routine check to ensure that the information that you provided on your return is correct.\nIf you receive a request from the CRA asking for documents or receipts, you should reply within the timeframe given. Make sure to include all of the information that the CRA asks for, and that the copies of your documents are clear and easy to read.\nRemember that the CRA is here to help you. If you can't get the documents that the CRA is asking for, have questions, or need more time to reply, let the CRA know. If you don't reply to the CRA's request, the CRA may adjust your return and your claim or deduction may\u00a0be disallowed.\nFor more information, go to Review of your tax return.\nHow to change a return\nIf you have more information that could change the result of a return that you have already sent to the CRA, do not file another return for that year. Wait until you receive your notice of assessment before asking for changes.\nGenerally, you can only request a change to a return for a tax year ending in any of the 10 previous calendar years. For example, a request made in 2022\u00a0must relate to a tax year after 2011 to be considered.\nYou can change your return by completing and sending\u00a0Form\u00a0T1-ADJ, T1 Adjustment Request, as well as any supporting documents, to the CRA if you have not sent them before to support your original claim.\nNote\nIf the CRA has assessed your taxes owing for a year that you did not file a tax return, you must file a return for that year if you want to make a change.\nFor more information, go to How to change a return.\nCRA Service Feedback Program\nService complaints\nYou can expect to be treated fairly under clear and established rules, and get a high level of service each time you deal with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).

The Register of Future Electors allows young Canadian citizens aged 14 to 17 to register with Elections Canada before turning 18. Once they turn 18 and their eligibility to vote is confirmed, they are added to the National Register of Electors.\nElections Canada uses the information in the National Register of Electors to prepare lists of electors for federal elections, by-elections and referendums and to communicate with voters. Other uses of the information permitted under the Canada Elections Act include providing voter information to provincial and territorial electoral agencies for uses permitted under their respective legislation, and providing voter information (not including birth dates) to members of Parliament, registered and eligible political parties, and candidates at election time.\nInformation in the Register of Future Electors cannot be shared with members of Parliament, registered or eligible political parties, or candidates. However, it can be shared with the provincial and territorial electoral agencies that are allowed to collect future elector information under their respective legislation. It can also be used by Elections Canada to provide youth with educational information about the electoral process.\nOnly persons 18 years of age or older who have Canadian citizenship are qualified to vote. Generally, you are a Canadian citizen either by birth or if you have obtained Canadian citizenship through the formal process of becoming a Canadian citizen (naturalization). If\u00a0you are unsure about your Canadian citizenship status, refer to the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada website at See if you may be a citizen.\nQuestions A and B are optional. If you are a Canadian citizen 18 years of age or older, you will not lose your right to vote regardless of whether you answer the questions or leave them blank.

Use the information in this tax package, along with your information slips, receipts, and supporting documents, to complete your return.\nNote\nEven if you did not have any income in the year, you still have to file a return to get the benefits, credits, and refund you are entitled to.\nNew for 2021\nTax changes and improvements to services are noted in this section. Also noted are changes to income tax rules, including those that were announced but not yet law when this guide was published in November 2021. If these changes become law as proposed or announced, they will be effective for 2021 or as the dates given. If new legislation is introduced, information will be available at\u00a0Personal income tax: What's new for 2021. New items are flagged with \u00a0New\u00a0throughout the guide.\nSeveral changes have been made to the tax package, such as making the guide easier to read and moving the text for some income, deductions, and credits to the Federal Worksheet and schedules. You can also find more information about the lines on the return by going to\u00a0canada.ca/line-xxxxx and replacing \"xxxxx\" with any 5-digit line number from the return. For example, go to canada.ca/line-10100 for information about line 10100. If you need information that is not provided in your tax package, call\n1-800-959-8281 from Canada or the United States or call\u00a0613-940-8495 from outside Canada and the United States.\nCOVID-19 benefits and your taxes\nAmounts received related to COVID-19\nIf you received federal, provincial, or territorial government COVID-19\u00a0benefit payments, such as the Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB), Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit (CRSB), or Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit (CRCB), you will receive a T4A slip with instructions on how to report these amounts on your return. These slips are also available in My Account.\nIf you are self-employed and received federal, provincial, or territorial government COVID-19 assistance for your business, such as the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS), Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy (CERS), Canada Recovery Hiring Program (CRHP) or Fish Harvester Benefit and Grant Program (FHBGP), you have to include these amounts in your business income or reduce your expenses by the amounts you received. If you received a government loan, the loan is not taxable but you have to include in your business income any portion of the loan that is forgivable.\nIf you received the CRB, you may have to repay all or part of the amount received if your net income after certain adjustments is more than $38,000. The repayment is calculated using the chart for\u00a0line 23500\u00a0of the Federal Worksheet.\nIf your income was tax exempt\nIf your CRB, CRCB, or CRSB income is eligible for tax exemption under section 87 of the Indian Act, complete Form T90, Income Exempt from Tax under the Indian Act, and file your 2021 Income Tax and Benefit Return for Non-Residents or Deemed Residents of Canada to claim the tax withheld on your CRB, CRCB, and CRSB payments. For more information, go to\u00a0Taxes and benefits for Indigenous peoples.\nFederal COVID-19 benefits repayment\nIf you repaid federal COVID-19 benefits (CERB, CESB, CRB, CRCB, or CRSB) in 2021 that you received in 2020, the amount repaid will be reported in box 201 of your T4A slip or on your T4E slip along with other employment insurance (EI) amounts repaid. You can choose to claim a deduction on your return for the repayment in the year that the benefit was received or in the year that the benefit was repaid. You may also choose to split the deduction between these two returns as long as the total deduction is not more than the amount repaid. For more information, see line 23210 or go to Repay COVID-19 Benefits.\nIndividuals and families\nCanada workers benefit\nThe Canada workers benefit (CWB) rates and income thresholds have changed for 2021. A new \"secondary earner exemption\" has also been introduced. For more information, see Schedule 6, Canada Workers Benefit.\nZero-emission vehicles\nThe definition of zero-emission vehicle has changed for vehicles acquired after March 1, 2020. A vehicle may still qualify as a zero-emission vehicle if the vehicle was subject to a prior capital cost allowance (CCA) or terminal loss claim provided that the vehicle was not acquired by the taxpayer on a tax-deferred \"rollover\" basis or previously owned or acquired by the taxpayer or a non-arm's length person or partnership. For more information, see Guide T4002, Self-employed Business, Professional, Commission, Farming, and Fishing Income, if you are self-employed, or Guide T4044, Employment Expenses, if you are claiming employment expenses.\nImportant\nThe legislation for the following measures was not finalized at the time that the tax package was printed. When the legislation is finalized, the CRA will\u00a0republish electronically\u00a0any revised guides and forms at\u00a0Forms and publications. If you file your return before the revised forms are available, you may need to change your return. For more information, see\u00a0How to change a return.\nDisability tax credit\nThe rules relating to the mental functions necessary for everyday life, life-sustaining therapy, and the calculation of therapy time would change. For more information about the disability tax credit, see Guide RC4064, Disability-Related Information, or go to Tax credits and deductions for persons with disabilities.\nNorthern residents deductions\nThe deduction for travel benefits has changed and been expanded to be available to eligible northern residents who take a trip even if their employer does not provide travel benefits for personal travel. For more information about the Northern residents deductions, see Information Sheet RC4650, Northern Residents Deductions,\u00a0or go to\u00a0Line 25500 \u2013 Northern residents deductions.\nPostdoctoral fellowship income\nBeginning in 2021, postdoctoral fellowship income would be included as earned income for registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) purposes. This change would provide postdoctoral fellows with additional RRSP contribution room in order to make deductible RRSP, pooled registered pension plan (PRPP), or specified pension plan (SPP) contributions. This measure would apply retroactively to 2011. If you reported postdoctoral fellowship income in a tax year after 2010 and before 2021, you could send an adjustment request to the CRA to have your RRSP contribution room adjusted.\nDo you have to file a return?\nFile a return for 2021 if:\nYou have to pay tax for the year\nYou want to claim a refund\nYou want to claim the Canada workers benefit (CWB) or you received CWB advance payments in the year\nYou or your spouse or common-law partner want to begin or continue receiving credits and benefits (including any related provincial or territorial payments) such as:\nCanada child benefit (CCB)\ngoods and services tax \u2044 harmonized sales tax (GST/HST) credit\nguaranteed income supplement (GIS)\nNote\nIf you have a spouse or common-law partner, they also have to file a return.\nFor more information, see Booklet T4114, Canada Child Benefit and related federal, provincial, and territorial programs, and Guide RC4210, GST/HST Credit.\nThe CRA sent you a request to file a return\nYou and your spouse or common-law partner are jointly electing to split pension income (see line 11600)\nYou were a deemed resident of Canada at any time in the year and disposed of capital property (which could be a principal residence) or realized a taxable capital gain in the year\nYou were a non-resident of Canada throughout 2021 and disposed of taxable Canadian property in 2021; however, if all of the gain from each disposition is exempt under a tax treaty or if you received a Certificate of Compliance for the disposition where no payment of tax was required, you may not have to file a tax return (for more information, go to Disposing of or acquiring certain Canadian property)\nYou have to repay all or part of your old age security (OAS) benefits, employment insurance (EI) benefits, or Canada recovery benefit (CRB).

For more information, see Schedule A, or contact the CRA.\nWere you a non-resident of Canada in 2021 who wants to elect under section\u00a0217?\nUnder section 217 of the Income Tax Act, you can choose to file a Canadian return and report certain types of Canadian-source income. You are then electing under section 217 of the Income Tax Act. By doing this, you may pay tax on this income using an alternative method and may receive a refund of some or all of the non-resident tax withheld.\nWere you a non-resident of Canada in 2021 who wants to elect under section\u00a0216.1?\nUnder section\u00a0216.1 of the Income Tax Act, if you are a non-resident actor, you can choose to report amounts paid, credited, or provided as a benefit to you for film and video acting services rendered in Canada on a Canadian return and pay tax on that income using an alternative taxing method. Choosing to do this is called \"Electing under section\u00a0216.1.\"\nDeemed non-residents of Canada\nYou were a deemed non-resident of Canada in 2021 if you would have been considered a resident of Canada (or a deemed resident) but, under a tax treaty, you were considered a resident of another country. You become a deemed non-resident of Canada when your ties with the other country are such that, under the tax treaty, you would be considered a resident of that other country and not Canada. In this case, the same rules that apply to a non-resident of Canada will apply to you as a deemed non-resident (including the way you complete your return).\nDeemed residents of Canada\nYou were a deemed resident of Canada for tax purposes if you did not have significant residential ties in Canada, but you stayed in Canada for 183 days or more in 2021 and, under a tax treaty, you were not considered a resident of another country.\u00a0Additionally, you may be considered a deemed resident of Quebec if you stayed in the province of Quebec during that period. For more information, contact Revenu Qu\u00e9bec.\nYou were also a deemed resident of Canada if you lived outside Canada during 2021, you were not considered a factual resident of Canada because you did not have significant residential ties in Canada, and you were one of the following:\na member of the Canadian Forces overseas school staff and you choose to file a return as a deemed resident of Canada (if you left Canada during 2021, see Were you a member of the overseas Canadian Forces school staff who left Canada in 2021?)\na federal or provincial government employee and you were either a resident of Canada just before being posted abroad or you received a representation allowance for\u00a02021\na person working under a Global Affairs Canada assistance program if you were a resident of Canada at any time during the three-month period just before you began your duties abroad\na member of the Canadian Forces at any time in 2021\na person who, under a tax treaty, agreement, or convention between Canada and another country, is exempt from tax in that other country on 90% or more of your income from all sources because of your relationship to a resident (including a deemed resident) of Canada\na dependent child of one of the first four persons described earlier in this section and your net world income in 2021 was not more than the basic personal amount in Canadian dollars\nIncome you should report\nReport your 2021 world income. World income is income from all sources both inside and outside Canada.\nWere you a member of the overseas Canadian Forces school staff who left Canada in 2021?\nIf you were a member of the overseas Canadian Forces school staff who left Canada in 2021 and severed residential ties, you became a non-resident of Canada. Use the 2021 income tax package for the province or territory where you lived just before you left Canada. Go to Individuals \u2013 Leaving or entering Canada and non-residents for the speical rules that apply to you. However, you can choose to file as a deemed resident of Canada while you are serving abroad. If so, use the 2021 income tax package for the province or territory where you lived just before you left Canada. In future years, you will use the Income Tax and Benefit Guide for Non-Residents and Deemed Residents of Canada.\nDid you live in Quebec just before you left Canada?\nIn addition to being considered a deemed resident of Canada, under Quebec law, you may also be considered a deemed resident of the province of Quebec. If so, you may have to pay Quebec income tax while you are serving abroad.\nFor example, if you are a deemed resident of Canada and were, at any time in the year, an agent-general, an officer, or a servant of the province of Quebec and you were a resident of that province just before your appointment or employment with that province, you must pay Quebec income tax.\nDeemed residents of Quebec\nTo avoid double taxation (surtax for non-residents and deemed residents of Canada plus Quebec income tax), attach a note to your federal return stating\u00a0the following:\nYou are subject to Quebec income tax\nYou are filing a Revenu Qu\u00e9bec Income Tax Return\nYou are asking for relief from the non-resident and deemed resident surtax\nFor more information, contact the CRA.\nThe province of Quebec also grants relief to certain taxpayers who were deemed residents of Canada and Quebec. This includes deemed residents of Canada who are members of the Canadian Forces or, at any time in the year, an ambassador, minister, high commissioner, officer, or servant of Canada, and who were also deemed residents of Quebec. For more information, contact Revenu Qu\u00e9bec.\nElecting under section\u00a0217\nAs a non-resident of Canada, Canadian payers have to withhold non-resident tax on certain types of Canadian-source income they pay or credit to you. The tax withheld is usually your final tax obligation to Canada on this income and you do not have to file a Canadian tax return to report it. However, you can choose to file a Canadian return to report certain types of Canadian-source income listed in the next section by \"electing under section\u00a0217 of the Income Tax Act.\" In doing so, you may pay tax on this income using a different method and may receive a refund of all or part of the non-resident tax withheld.\nIf you filed Form NR5, Application by a Non-Resident of Canada for a Reduction in the Amount of Non-Resident Tax Required to be Withheld, for the year, and the CRA approved it, you generally have to file a section 217 return by June 30 of the year following each year of the period covered by the approved Form NR5. For more information, see Pamphlet T4145, Electing under Section 217 of the Income Tax Act.\nNote\nWhen approved by the CRA, Form NR5 is valid for a period\u00a0of 5 tax years.\nEligible section 217 income\nYou have the option of filing a section 217 return for 2021, even if you did not send Form NR5 to the CRA, if you received any of the following types of Canadian-source income (referred to as \"eligible section 217 income\") in 2021 while you were a\nnon-resident of Canada:\nold age security pension\nCanada Pension Plan and Quebec Pension Plan benefits\nmost superannuation and pension benefits\nmost registered retirement savings plan payments\nmost pooled registered pension plans\nmost registered retirement income fund payments\ndeath benefits\nemployment insurance benefits\ncertain retiring allowances\nregistered supplementary unemployment benefit plan payments\nmost deferred profit-sharing plan payments\namounts received from a retirement compensation arrangement, or the purchase price of an interest in a retirement compensation arrangement\nprescribed benefits under a government assistance program\nAuto Pact benefits\nNote\nInterest and other investment income, rental income, and workers' compensation benefits are not eligible section 217 income and are not to be reported on this return, but must be included in your world income when you complete Schedule\u00a0A, Statement of World Income.\nSection\u00a0217 return due date\nYour 2021 section 217 return must be filed\u00a0on or before June 30, 2022.\nNote\nIf you have a balance owing for 2021, you have to pay it on or before April 30, 2022. If you owe tax for 2021 and do not file your return for 2021 within the dates specified, the CRA will charge you a late-filing penalty.

Make sure to include all of the information that the CRA asks for and that the copies of your documents are clear and easy to read.\nRemember that the CRA is here to help you. If you can't get the documents that the CRA is asking for, have questions, or need more time to reply, let the CRA know. If you don't reply to the CRA's request, the CRA may adjust your return and your claim or deduction may\u00a0be disallowed.\nFor more information, go to Income tax review? You've got this!\nHow to change a return\nIf you have more information that could change the result of a return that you have already sent to the CRA, do not file another return for that year. Wait until you receive your notice of assessment before asking for changes.\nGenerally, you can only request a change to a return for a tax year ending in any of the 10 previous calendar years. For example, a request made in 2022 must relate to a tax year after 2011 to be considered.\nYou can change your return in any of the following ways:\nusing the ReFILE service if your return was filed electronically using a certified software. For more information,\u00a0go to\u00a0ReFILE: Online adjustments for income tax and benefit returns\nsigning in to\u00a0My Account for Individuals\u00a0and using \u201cChange my return\u201d\nsending\u00a0Form T1-ADJ, T1 Adjustment Request, by mail, as well as any supporting documents, if you have not sent them before to support your original claim\nNote\nIf the CRA has assessed your taxes owing for a year that you did not file a tax return, you must file a paper return for that year if you want to make a change.\nFor more information, go to How to change your return.\nCRA Service Feedback Program\nService complaints\nYou can expect to be treated fairly under clear and established rules, and get a high level of service each time you deal with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).

Use the information in the\u00a0tax package, along with your information slips, receipts, and supporting documents, to complete your return.\nNote\nEven if you did not have any income in the year, you still have to file a return to get the benefits, credits, and refund you are entitled to.\nNew for 2021\nTax changes and improvements to services are noted in this section. Also noted are changes to income tax rules, including those that were announced but not yet law when this guide was published in November 2021. If these changes become law as proposed or announced, they will be effective for 2021 or as of the dates given. If new legislation is introduced, information will be available at Personal income tax: What's new. New items are flagged with NEW! throughout the guide.\nSeveral changes have been made to the tax package, such as making the guide easier to read and moving the text for some income, deductions, and credits to the Federal Worksheet and schedules. You can also find more information about the lines on the return by going to canada.ca/line-xxxxx and replacing \"xxxxx\" with any 5-digit line number from the return. For example, go to canada.ca/line-10100 for information about line 10100. If you need information that is not provided in this tax package,\u00a0call 1-800-959-8281.\nThe Canada Revenue Agency\u2019s services\nElectronic notices of assessment or reassessment for electronic filers\nSometime\u00a0in 2022, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)\u00a0will start the process of switching to electronic notices of assessment or reassessment when you file your income tax and benefit return. For more information, see Notice of assessment.\nCOVID-19 benefits and your taxes\nAmounts received related to COVID-19\nIf you received federal, provincial, or territorial government COVID-19\u00a0benefit payments, such as the Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB), Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit (CRSB), or Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit (CRCB), you will receive a T4A slip with instructions on how to report these amounts on your return. These slips are also available in My Account for Individuals.\nIf you are self-employed and received federal, provincial, or territorial government COVID-19 assistance for your business, such as the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS), Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy (CERS), Canada Recovery Hiring Program (CRHP) or Fish Harvester Benefit and Grant Program (FHBGP), you have to include these amounts in your business income or reduce your expenses by the amounts you received. If you received a government loan, the loan is not taxable but you have to include in your business income any portion of the loan that is forgivable.\nIf you received the CRB, you may have to repay all or part of the amount received if your net income after certain adjustments is more\u00a0than $38,000. The repayment is calculated using the chart for line 23500 of the Federal Worksheet.\nIf your income was tax exempt\nIf your CRB, CRCB, or CRSB\u00a0income is eligible for tax exemption under section 87 of the Indian Act, complete\u00a0Form T90, Income Exempt from Tax under the Indian Act, and file your 2021 Income Tax and Benefit Return\u00a0or simplified return to claim the tax withheld on your CRB, CRCB, and CRSB\u00a0payments. For more information, go to Taxes and benefits for Indigenous peoples.\nFederal COVID-19 benefits repayment\nIf you repaid federal COVID-19 benefits (CERB, CESB,\u00a0CRB, CRCB, or\u00a0CRSB) in 2021 that you received in 2020, the amount repaid will be reported in box 201 of your T4A slip\u00a0or on your T4E slip along with other employment insurance (EI) amounts repaid. You can choose to claim a deduction on your return for the repayment in the year that the benefit was received or in the year that the benefit was repaid. You may also choose to split the deduction between these two returns as long as the total deduction is not more than the amount repaid. For more information, see line 23210 or go to Repay COVID-19 benefits.\nIndividuals\u00a0and families\nCanada workers benefit\nThe Canada workers benefit (CWB) rates and income thresholds have changed for 2021. A new \u201csecondary earner exemption\u201d has also been introduced. For more information, see Schedule 6, Canada Workers Benefit.\nZero-emission vehicles\nThe definition of zero-emission vehicle has changed for vehicles acquired after March 1, 2020. A vehicle may still qualify as a zero-emission vehicle if the vehicle was subject to a prior capital cost allowance (CCA) or terminal loss claim provided that the vehicle was not acquired by the taxpayer on a tax-deferred \"rollover\" basis or previously owned or acquired by the taxpayer or a non-arm's length person or partnership. For more information, see Guide T4002, Self-employed Business, Professional, Commission, Farming, and Fishing Income, if you are self-employed, or Guide T4044, Employment Expenses, if you are claiming employment expenses.\nImportant\nThe legislation for the following measures was not finalized at the time that the tax package was printed. When the legislation is finalized, the CRA will republish electronically any revised guides and forms at\u00a0Forms and publications. If you file your return before the revised forms are available, you may need to change your return. For more information, see\u00a0How to change a return.\nDisability tax credit\nThe rules relating to the mental functions necessary for everyday life, life-sustaining therapy, and the calculation of therapy time would change. For more information about the disability tax credit, see Guide RC4064, Disability-Related Information, or go to Tax credits and deductions for persons with disabilities.\nNorthern residents deductions\nThe deduction for travel benefits would change and be expanded to be available to eligible northern residents who take a trip even if their employer does not provide travel benefits for personal travel. For more information about the Northern residents deductions, see Information Sheet RC4650, Northern Residents Deductions, or go to Line 25500 \u2013\u00a0Northern residents deductions.\nPostdoctoral fellowship income\nBeginning in 2021, postdoctoral fellowship income would be included as earned income for registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) purposes. This change would provide postdoctoral fellows with additional RRSP\u00a0contribution room in order to make deductible RRSP,\u00a0pooled registered pension plan (PRPP), or specified pension plan (SPP) contributions. This measure would apply retroactively to 2011. If you reported postdoctoral fellowship income in a tax year after 2010 and before 2021, you could send an adjustment request to the CRA\u00a0to have your RRSP\u00a0contribution room adjusted.\nDo you have to file a return?\nFile a return for 2021\u00a0if:\nYou have to pay tax for the year\nYou want to claim a refund\nYou want to claim the\u00a0Canada workers benefit (CWB)\u00a0or you received CWB\u00a0advance payments in the year\nYou or your spouse or common-law partner want to begin or continue receiving credits and benefits (including any related provincial or territorial payments) such as:\nCanada child benefit (CCB)\ngoods and services tax \u2044 harmonized sales tax (GST/HST) credit\nguaranteed income supplement (GIS)\nNote\nIf you have a spouse or common-law partner, they also have to file a return.

We encourage you to apply for Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits and allow a Service Canada representative to determine if you are eligible. Learn how we assess applications for the disability benefit.\nDo you qualify for a disability or children\u2019s benefit\nCPP disability benefit\nThe disability benefit is a monthly payment you can get if you:\nare under 65\ncontributed enough to the Canada Pension Plan\nhave a mental or physical disability that regularly stops you from doing any type of substantially gainful work\nhave a disability that is long-term and of indefinite duration, or is likely to result in death\nCPP post-retirement disability benefit\nIf you currently get the monthly CPP retirement pension, you could receive the Canada Pension Plan post-retirement disability benefit if you:\nare 60 to 65\ncontributed enough to the CPP\nhave a mental or physical disability that regularly stops you from doing any type of substantially gainful work\nhave a disability that is long-term and of indefinite duration, or is likely to result in death\nhave been receiving the CPP retirement pension for more than 15 months or become disabled after starting to receive the retirement pension\nCPP Children\u2019s benefit\nIf you are getting a disability benefit, any of your dependent children can get a monthly payment if they are:\nunder 18, or\nbetween 18 and 25 and attending school full time\nFind out more about the CPP Children\u2019s benefit.\nOther circumstances\nIf you live in Quebec\nIf you live in Quebec, you would not apply for the disability benefit under the Canada Pension Plan. You can apply for the Quebec Pension Plan disability benefit if one of the following applies to you:\nyou have worked only in the province of Quebec\nyou currently live in Quebec and have worked both in the province of Quebec and in another province or territory\nyou have worked in Quebec, currently live outside Canada and your last province of residence was Quebec\nIf you worked both in and outside Quebec\nIf you paid into both the Canada Pension Plan and Quebec Pension Plan, you need to apply to the province where you live now.\nIf you worked outside Canada\nIf you worked in a country other than Canada, the credits you earned in that country may help you qualify for the disability benefit.\nIf you worked less to care for young children\nIf you have periods of zero or low income because you stayed home to raise your children, the child-rearing provision could help you qualify for the disability benefit.\nIf you are divorced or separated\nAny contributions you and your spouse or common-law partner made to the CPP while you lived together may be equally divided after a divorce or a separation. This may help you qualify for the disability benefit. Find out more about credit splitting for divorced or separated couples.\nIf you missed applying for disability benefits in the past\nIf you are applying for the disability benefit, but stopped working a while ago, you may still apply for a benefit now.\nYou may be able to receive the benefit if:\nyou had contributed enough years to the Canada Pension Plan before you first became severely disabled\nyou have been continuously disabled from that date up to now\nIf you are in this situation, contact us.\nIf you were incapacitated\nIf you are or were incapable of forming or expressing an intention to make an application, contact us.\nDocument navigation\nPrevious - Overview\nNext - How much could you receive\nPage feedback\nDid you find what you were looking for?\nYes Yes No\nIf not, tell us why below:\nWhat was wrong?\nI can't find the information\nThe information is hard to understand\nThere was an error or something didn't work\nOther reason\nPlease provide more details (maximum 300 characters)\nYou will not receive a reply.

You must request this review in writing within 90 days of receiving your decision letter.\nYour application will be reviewed by Service Canada staff who were not involved in making the original decision on your application.\nMore information on how to request a review of the decision\nThere are 3 ways you can make your request for reconsideration:\nsubmit your request online using My Service Canada Account (MSCA), or\ncomplete and submit the Request for Reconsideration of a Canada Pension Plan Disability Decision form (ISP-1145), or\nprepare and submit a written request to review the decision and include:\nyour name\nyour address\nyour telephone number\nyour Social Insurance Number or Client Identification Number\na detailed explanation of why you do not agree with the decision\nany new information that could affect the decision\nyour signature and the date\nIf you complete your request on paper\nSign and date your written request and submit it:\nelectronically by signing into My Service Canada account, or\nby mail to the return address on the decision letter, or\nin person at a Service Canada office\nReconsiderations can take several months to complete, depending on the case. Service Canada will review your application and any new information you submit in support of your request and send you a (new) decision by mail.\nIf you need help with your application\nYou may want a representative to help you through the application and reconsideration process. A representative is someone who you choose. Your representative can be a friend, a family member, a lawyer, or another professional.\nIf you would like a representative to help you communicate with Service Canada about your application or reconsideration, you will need to:\ncomplete a Consent to Communicate Information to an Authorized Person form, and\nmail it to the address on your decision letter, or you may drop it off at your closest Service Canada Centre\nYou can change or cancel your representative at any time, by notifying Service Canada in writing.\nIf you disagree with the new decision\nIf you disagree with the new decision, you can contact the Social Security Tribunal to appeal.\nIf you would like a representative to help you communicate with the Social Security Tribunal about your appeal, you will need to:\ncomplete section 9 of the Notice of Appeal \u2013 Income Security \u2013 General Division form, or\ncall the Social Security Tribunal and provide your representative's information.\nYou must contact the Social Security Tribunal directly to change or cancel your representative.\nNote: \u00a0If you would like your representative to communicate with both Service Canada and the Social Security Tribunal, fill out section 9 of the Notice of Appeal form for the Social Security Tribunal and complete the Consent to Communicate Information to an Authorized Person form for Service Canada.\nYour first payment\nYour decision letter will give you the date and amount of your first payment.\nCPP disability payments are taxable income\nTaxes are not automatically deducted each month. You can ask that federal income tax be deducted from your monthly payment by:\nsigning into your My Service Canada Account, or\ncompleting the Request for voluntary Federal Income tax Deductions CPP/OAS (ISP-3520CPP) form and mailing it to us or dropping it off at a Service Canada office\nIf you do not ask for monthly tax deductions, you may have to pay your income tax each quarter.\nWhile on CPP disability benefits\nReviewing your case\nFrom time to time, cases are reviewed to ensure that only eligible people receive disability benefits.\nIf your case is being reviewed, you may be asked to provide current medical and other information. Because everyone's medical condition and capacity to work is unique, each case is looked at individually.\nOnce all the necessary information has been collected, a decision to continue or stop disability benefits is made. We will inform you of this decision in writing.\nVolunteer and educational activities\nIf you are going to school and/or if you are volunteering, you must inform Service Canada if you:\nare doing any of these activities for a combined total of 15 hours a week or more, and\nhave been doing these activities on a regular basis for 4 months or longer\nSchool can include college, university, a trade or a technical training program, and can be in person or online.\nThe amount of time you spend going to school or training includes the time you spend in all activities related to attending school. These activities can include studying, researching, writing papers, completing assignments and more.\nYou must also notify Service Canada if you complete a school, university, trade, technical training or rehabilitation program.\nService Canada recognizes the importance of volunteer work, education and training. Many of our beneficiaries can participate in volunteer work and education/training and continue to receive their CPP disability benefits.\nHowever, in some cases this could signal your ability to work and could impact whether you still qualify to receive CPP disability benefits.\nExamples\nVolunteering over 15 hours a week for more than 4 months\nJohn has been receiving CPP disability pension since November 2015. John has started volunteering as a cashier at a cafeteria and selling clothing. He volunteers 5 days a week, for 5 hours a day since January 2019. His duties include pricing, handling money, cooking and cleaning.\nJohn needs to report this activity to Service Canada. John's benefits may be impacted if it is determined his activity demonstrates work capacity.\nCombination of volunteering and educational activity totaling over 15 hours a week for more than 4 months\nMichael has been receiving CPP disability pension since 2015. Six months ago, he started providing free business advice to the business community. He offers his services online for 3 to 4 hours a day, 5 days a week. Sometimes Michael takes mini virtual courses to improve his service offerings.\nMichael needs to report this activity to Service Canada. Michael's benefits may be impacted if it is determined his activities are demonstrating work capacity.\nVolunteering under 15 hours a week for more than 4 months\nMargo has been receiving CPP disability pension since June of 2019. Since then, she sometimes volunteers at a community centre nearby. Her duties included, shredding old documents, photocopying pamphlets and putting them out for display. She spends anywhere from 5 to 10 hours per week at the centre, on a drop in basis whenever she can.\nMargo does not need to report this activity to Service Canada. Although she has participated in volunteer activity for over 4 months, the activity is under the reporting threshold of 15 hours per week.\nWorking and earning money\nYou must contact Service Canada when you begin working, and once you have earned $6,600 (before tax) in 2023 . Your disability benefits may be impacted by your gross (before tax) earnings:\nif you earn below $6,600 (before tax), this alone should not affect your disability benefits\nif you earn between $6,600 and $18,508.36 (before tax), this may show that you are regularly capable of working and it may affect your disability benefits\nif you earn $18,508.36 (before tax) or more, this demonstrates you are regularly capable of working and you will likely no longer qualify for disability benefits\nIf you delay in contacting us when you start making over the allowed amount, you might have to pay some money back.\nVocational rehabilitation program\nIf you are thinking of returning to work, a variety of services such as guidance, training, and job placement may be available.\nLearn more about the vocational rehabilitation program\nThree-month work trial\nIf you return to work on a regular basis, you may be able to continue to receive your disability benefits for 3 months. This gives you and the CPP time to evaluate your ability to work regularly.\nIf you are still capable of working after 3 months, your CPP disability benefits will likely stop.\nRe-starting disability benefits for the same disability\nIf you are no longer able to work after your benefits stop, you may qualify for Automatic Reinstatement or the Fast Track Re-application process. These are designed to get you back into pay as quickly as possible when you are unable to continue working due to a reoccurrence of the same or related disability.\nThis is also true if your benefit stopped because of your self reported volunteer and/or educational activities.\nExamples\nReporting a Return to Work\nTara plans to return to work. Tara's benefits can continue while she tries working. She must contact Service Canada once she earns $6,400 (before tax), at which time she is eligible for a 3-month work trial. This provides Tara and Service Canada time to evaluate her ability to work on a regular basis. If Tara is still working after the end of the work trial, this may show that she is regularly capable of working and it may affect her disability benefits.\nNot Reporting a Return to Work\nRobert returned to the workforce, but did not contact Service Canada. He is no longer able to do his job as a roofer but his company offered him light work as an estimator. He returned to work in March working 30 hours a week. Since Robert did not report his return to work, he may no longer be eligible for the CPP disability benefit and may be required to pay back benefits to which he was not entitled to receive.\nSelf-Employment\nCynthia started her own company. She designs and sells clothing when she feels well enough. Cynthia has the same responsibilities as other beneficiaries who return to work and must contact Service Canada once she earns $6,400 (before tax). The gross business earnings of Cynthia's business and her involvement in the day-to-day business will be considered in the review of her file.\nWork Trial\nAmina contacted Service Canada to report that she had returned to work. Amina was provided a three-month work trial to test her ability to work. At the end of the three-month work trial, Amina had earned $7,200, despite missing many days of work due to her medical condition. She was unable to continue working due to her medical condition. Service Canada determined that Amina's condition remained severe and prolonged and she remained eligible to receive CPP disability benefits.\nAutomatic Reinstatement\nRaj contacted Service Canada when he returned to work. His benefits were stopped after a successful 3-month work trial. Less than 2 years later, his disability worsened and he could no longer continue working. Since Raj had reported his return to work and his disability reoccurred within 2 years, he was eligible for the automatic reinstatement of this benefits. This means that his benefits could be reinstated without having to go through the usual application process.\nWhen your benefit could stop\nThe disability benefit is meant to replace some of your employment income for as long as your disability stops you from working at any job on a regular basis.\nYour disability benefit will stop if you:\nyou are capable of working on a regular basis\nyou are no longer disabled\nyou turn 65\nyou die\nWhen a disability benefit is cancelled, any related children's benefits are also cancelled.\nWhen you turn 65\nWhen you turn 65 the disability benefit will automatically be changed to a Canada Pension Plan retirement pension. If you are getting the post-retirement disability benefit, it will stop.\nYour retirement pension will be less than your disability benefit. However, you can also apply for Old Age Security and the Guaranteed Income Supplement. Your spouse or common-law partner may also be eligible for the Allowance benefit if they are 60 to 64 (up to and including the month of their 65th birthday).\nWhen someone dies\nIf you're reading this following the loss of a loved one, please accept our condolences.\nWhen someone dies, please inform us as soon as possible to avoid overpayment. Find out how to cancel CPP benefits on behalf of a deceased person.\nThe estate and survivors may be eligible to receive other CPP benefits:\nDeath benefit\nSurvivor's pension\nDocument navigation\nPrevious - 4.

However, if you do not have online access, you can obtain further information on how to apply for the Benefit using the toll free number 1-833-966-2099.\nUnder what circumstances can I apply for the CERB?\nThe Canada Emergency Response Benefit is available to those who stop working for reasons related to COVID-19, for example:\nyou have lost your job\nyou are in quarantine or sick due to COVID-19\nyou are taking care of others because they are in quarantine or sick due to COVID-19, and/or\nyou are taking care of children or other dependents because their care facility is closed due to COVID-19\nThere may be other reasons related to COVID-19 beyond these examples why you may have stopped working. However, you cannot voluntarily quit your job.\nAlternatively, you can apply for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit if:\nyou are eligible for Employment Insurance regular or sickness benefits, or\nyou are a former Employment Insurance claimant who used up your entitlement to your Employment Insurance regular or fishing benefits between December 29, 2019 and October 3, 2020\nTo get the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, you may not earn more than $1,000 for a period of at least 14 consecutive days within the initial 4-week period of your claim or $1,000 in total for each subsequent claim.\nHow do I know whether to apply for EI benefits or the CERB?\nIf you have stopped working because of COVID-19, you should apply for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.\nA single portal is available to assist you with the application process. You will be asked to answer a few simple questions, which will help direct you to complete the application best suited to your situation.\nFor anyone who became eligible for EI regular or sickness benefits on March 15, 2020, or later, your Employment Insurance claim will be automatically processed through the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.\nFor other Employment Insurance benefits, including maternity, parental, caregiving, fishing and work-sharing, you should continue to apply as you normally would.\nIf I am already receiving EI regular benefits, should I reapply for the CERB?\nNo.\nIf you are already receiving Employment Insurance regular benefits, you will continue to receive these benefits until the end of your benefit period.\nYou cannot be paid Employment Insurance benefits and the Canada Emergency Response Benefit for the same period.\nI have applied for EI regular or sickness benefits, but my claim hasn\u2019t been processed yet, do I need to reapply for the CERB?\nNo. You should not submit another application for the same benefit period.\nService Canada is processing all of these claims as quickly as possible.\nWhat if I stopped working before March 15th but only applied for EI after March 15th \u2013 which benefit will I receive?\nIf you became eligible for Employment Insurance regular or sickness benefits before March 15th, your claim will be processed under the pre-existing Employment Insurance rules. You will not receive the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.\nDo I need to provide any documentation when I apply for the CERB?\nYou will need to provide your personal contact information, your Social Insurance Number and confirm that you meet the eligibility requirements.\nYou may be asked to provide additional documentation to verify your eligibility at a future date.\nDo I need a medical certificate to receive the CERB if I am in quarantine or sick from COVID-19?\nNo.\nIs a Record of Employment required to apply for the CERB?\nA Record of Employment is not required to apply for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.\nHowever, employers are encouraged to provide a Record of Employment in the event that any employee should subsequently apply for Employment Insurance benefits.\nEligibility\nWhat are the eligibility criteria for the CERB?\nThe Benefit is available to workers:\nresiding in Canada, who are at least 15 years old\nwho have stopped working because of reasons related to COVID-19 or are eligible for Employment Insurance regular or sickness benefits or have exhausted their Employment Insurance regular or fishing benefits between December 29, 2019 and October 3, 2020\nwho had employment and/or self-employment income of at least $5,000 in 2019 or in the 12 months prior to the date of their application, and\nwho have not quit their job voluntarily\nWhen submitting your first claim, you cannot have earned more than $1,000 in employment and/or self-employment income for 14 or more consecutive days within the 4-week benefit period of your claim.\nWhen submitting subsequent claims, you cannot have earned more than $1,000 in employment and/or self-employment income for the entire 4-week benefit period of your new claim.\nProvided it is allowed in your province or territory, you may also receive provincial or territorial support payments at the same time you receive the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.\nDoes eligibility for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) now include a requirement to seek and accept work opportunities or to return to work when requested by your employer?\nEligibility for the CERB is unchanged. CERB continues to support workers by providing $500 a week to eligible workers, including the self-employed, who have stopped working and lost income due to COVID-19. The CERB responds to a broad range of situations that may require a person to stop working. However, a person is not eligible if they quit their job voluntarily.\nAs the economy gradually opens, the Government of Canada encourages workers who are able to return to work to do so, provided it is reasonable based on their individual circumstances. Workers who are able to work are also encouraged to consult the tools available through Job Bank, Canada\u2019s national employment service, to help with their job search.\nDo I need to be laid off to access the CERB?\nNo.\nWorkers who remain attached to their company can receive the Canada Emergency Response Benefit if they meet the eligibility requirements.\nCan you receive the CERB if you are not a citizen or permanent resident?\nYes if you meet the eligibility requirements, which includes residing in Canada and having a valid Social Insurance Number.\nAm I eligible for the CERB even if my job is still there but I don\u2019t feel comfortable going to work as a result of risk associated with COVID-19? For example, what if I have someone at home who has a compromised immune system and I cannot risk infecting them.\nThe Canada Emergency Response Benefit is available to those who stop working for reasons related to COVID-19, for example:\nyou have lost your job\nyou are in quarantine or sick due to COVID-19\nyou are taking care of others because they are in quarantine or sick due to COVID-19, and/or\nyou are taking care of children or other dependents because their care facility is closed due to COVID-19\nThere may be other reasons related to COVID-19 beyond these examples why you may have stopped working. However, you cannot voluntarily quit your job.\nIf you are concerned about the safety of your working conditions, you should discuss the situation with your employer.\nIf you work in a federally-regulated workplace, you may wish to consult your workplace health and safety committee or health and safety representative as well as the document \u201cRight to refuse dangerous work\u201d\nOtherwise, you may wish to consult the website for the department of labour in your province or territory for further information on your rights and the process you should follow\nThe Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety is another possible resource\nAm I eligible to apply for the CERB if I volunteer to be temporarily laid off by my employer to help them manage the pressures on their business?\nYes. You are eligible for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit if you are laid off as a result of reasons related to COVID-19, even if you maintain your attachment with your employer.\nIf I lost my job prior to March 15th for reasons related to COVID-19 will I be able to receive the CERB?\nIf you became eligible for Employment Insurance regular or sickness benefits prior to March 15th, your claim will be processed under the pre-existing Employment Insurance rules.\nIf you are not eligible for Employment Insurance regular or sickness benefits and lost your job prior to March 15th you may be eligible for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit delivered by the Canada Revenue Agency. However, the Benefit is only available for periods between March 15 and October 3, 2020.\nAm I eligible to apply for the CERB if I have not declared that I earned any money in the last year?\nWhile having filed income tax for 2019 is not an eligibility requirement, you will need to confirm when applying for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit that you had at least $5,000 in employment or self-employment income in 2019 or in the 12 months prior to the date of your application. You will also need to confirm that you have not earned more than $1,000 in employment and/or self-employment income in a period of at least 14 consecutive days within the first benefit period and for the entire 4-week benefit period of any subsequent claim. If you are deemed ineligible for the Benefit at a later date, you will be required to pay it back.\nThe income of at least $5,000 may be from employment and/or self-employment. For those who are not eligible for Employment Insurance you may also include maternity and parental benefits under the Employment Insurance program and/or similar benefits paid in Quebec under the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan as part of the calculation for income.\nCan employers send their employees off on furloughs to help cope with the decline in available work?\nEmployers can choose to ask their employees to take a furlough to help meet their business requirements.\nIn this case, the employee would be considered to have stopped working (unpaid leave) and eligible for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit provided they meet the other eligibility criteria.\nThere is no requirement for the employer-employee relationship to be severed and the employee can continue to receive other benefits such as medical benefits from the employer and still be eligible for the Benefit.\nIf an employee has stopped working but is still receiving benefits from their employer (for example, medical) are they eligible for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit?\nYes.\nStopping work does not mean that the employee has severed all ties with their employer. The employer can continue to provide non-cash benefits to the employee and these will not impact their eligibility for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.\nDoes being in receipt of severance impact a person\u2019s eligibility for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit?\nA severance payment does not impact an individual\u2019s eligibility for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.\nIncome Requirements\nWhat counts towards the $1,000 in income I can earn?\nThe $1,000 includes employment and/or self-employment income. This includes among others: tips you may earn while working; non-eligible dividends; honoraria (for example, nominal amounts paid to emergency service volunteers); and royalties (for example, paid to artists).\nHowever, royalty payments received from work that took place before the period for which a person applies for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit do not count as income during that specific benefit period.\nPensions, student loans and bursaries are not employment income and therefore, should not be included in the $1,000.\nApplications will be verified against tax records to confirm income.\nDoes the $1,000 limit on income from employment and/or self-employment for each 4-week benefit period apply to when income is earned or when income is received?\nFor the purposes of CERB, the $1,000 limit relates to earnings from employment and/or self-employment. Income is considered to be earned at the time work is performed and not when payment is received. Self-employed workers need to assess their earnings to determine whether they earned more than $1,000 during that period, regardless of whether they received a payment.\nWhat income types count towards the $5,000 in employment and/or self-employment income?\nThe $5,000 includes all employment and self-employment income. This includes among others: tips you have declared as income; non-eligible dividends; honoraria (for example, nominal amounts paid to emergency service volunteers); and royalties (for example, paid to artists). If you are not eligible for Employment Insurance, you may also include maternity and parental benefits you received from the Employment Insurance program and/or similar benefits paid in Quebec under the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan.\nPensions, student loans and bursaries are not considered employment income and should not be included.\nDoes the minimum income of $5,000 have to be earned in Canada?\nNo.\nThe income does not have to be earned in Canada, but you need to reside in Canada.\nIf I am in receipt of dividends am I eligible for the CERB?\nYes as long as the dividends are non-eligible dividends (generally those paid out of corporate income taxed at the small business rate) and you meet the eligibility criteria.\nNon-eligible dividends count towards the minimum $5,000 in income required for eligibility. Non-eligible dividends also count toward the $1,000 income threshold for a benefit period.\nDo artists\u2019 royalties count as employment or self-employment income with respect to the CERB?\nYes, in some cases. Artists\u2019 royalties would be considered payments received as self-employment income if they were received as compensation for using or allowing the use of a copyright, patent, trademark, formula or secret process that is a result of their own work or invention. These royalties count towards the $5,000 income threshold, as well as towards the $1,000 that claimants can earn per month while receiving the Benefit. However, royalty payments received from work that took place before the period for which a person applies for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit do not count as income during that specific benefit period. Other royalties (for example, from investment activities) do not count with respect to the Benefit.\nPayment\nHow much could I receive through the CERB?\nIf you meet the eligibility requirements, you would receive $500 per week to a maximum of 28 weeks.\nThe Benefit is taxable, you will be expected to report it as income when you file your income tax for the 2020 tax year.\nWhen and how will I receive my CERB payment? Is there a waiting period?\nThere is no waiting period so you will receive your Benefit within 10 days of applying.\nPayments will be made through direct deposit or by cheque; however direct deposit is faster.\nYour payments will be retroactive to the date you became eligible.\nIf I would be entitled to more than the $500 per week under EI, will I get the higher amount?\nNo.\nYou will receive $500 per week, regardless of what you may have been eligible to receive through Employment Insurance.\nHowever, once you are finished receiving the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, you will still be eligible to receive Employment Insurance at the higher rate provided you cannot find a job. Getting the Canada Emergency Response Benefit does not affect your EI entitlement.\nIf I would have been entitled to less than the $500 per week under EI, will I get the $500?\nYes.\nYou will receive $500 per week, regardless of what you may have been eligible to receive through Employment Insurance.\nWhat happens if I get a CERB payment I am not entitled to because I applied twice - once to the Canada Revenue Agency and once to Service Canada?\nCanadians should only apply for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit from either Service Canada OR the Canada Revenue Agency, not both.\u00a0 If you have already applied for Employment Insurance benefits but haven\u2019t received your benefits yet, you should not submit another application.\nWhile there will not be any penalty for Canadians if you have received a payment in error, you will have to repay the CERB benefits for which you are not entitled and will receive a letter from the CRA providing you with further information about the repayment process.\nSpecifically, if you have received the Canada Emergency Response Benefit twice for the same benefit period, you are requested to return one of the payments to the Canada Revenue Agency using the following procedure:\nif you still have the original Canada Emergency Response Benefit cheque, you can return the cheque by mail to the address below\nif you received the payment by direct deposit, or deposited the cheque, you can mail your repayment to the CRA. Be sure to:\nmake payment out to \u201cReceiver General for Canada\u201d\nindicate it is for \u201cRepayment of CERB\u201d\ninclude your Social Insurance Number (SIN) or your Temporary Tax Number (TTN)\nPlease do not send cash through the mail.\nPlease mail your payment to:\nRevenue Processing \u2013 Repayment of CERB\nSudbury Tax Centre\n1050 Notre Dame Avenue\nSudbury ON\u00a0\u00a0P3A\u00a00C1\nOnce I receive my first payment, can I assume I will receive my next payment 4 weeks later?\nNo, the renewal of payments will not be automatic. You must confirm your eligibility for each period for which you apply either online or by phone (1-833-966-2099).\nIf you are receiving your Benefit through Service Canada you must complete your EI Report Card to confirm your eligibility.\nMaternity/Parental benefits\nIf I am planning on going on maternity/parental leave shortly am I eligible for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit? Why was I put on EI regular benefits rather than the CERB? Will this impact my eligibility for Employment Insurance maternity and/or parental benefits?\nThe Government of Canada is committed to addressing the situation experienced by some expectant mothers applying for the CERB and receiving regular EI benefits when they should have been receiving the CERB. Anyone entitled to the CERB should be getting the CERB\nWe are also committed that being on the CERB will not affect an expectant mother\u2019s ability to collect EI maternity and parental benefits. We have come up with a way that will not negatively impact any expectant mother who should have been receiving the CERB\nAs way of background, Service Canada asks CERB applicants if they are pregnant and anticipating going on maternity/parental benefits to ensure that the claims are properly established with all the necessary information to allow the client to transition over to maternity/parental at the appropriate time without having to reapply\nThere was a limitation with the CERB system when expectant mothers disclosed they were pregnant, and women were being immediately put on EI benefits rather than the CERB. This was happening regardless of whether the expectant mother became eligible for EI before or after March 15th\nMarch 15th is an important date as it determines whether a claim will be processed through the regular EI system or through the CERB system. The triggering date is not the date of application\nExpectant mothers who lost their job and are eligible for EI prior to March 15th, should have received EI regular benefits, and when eligible, transition to EI maternity and parental benefits following the birth of their child\nThe benefits will be paid at the rate established under EI rules\nExpectant mothers who lost their job and are eligible for EI after March 15th should receive the CERB (to a maximum of 28 weeks) and when eligible, transition to EI maternity and parental benefits following the birth of their child\nCERB benefits will be paid out at the rate of $500/week\nAn expectant mother could potentially claim EI regular benefits in between the end of CERB and the beginning of EI maternity and parental benefits\nAs of May 8th, women who should have been receiving the CERB had their claims converted retroactively to the CERB\nThose who had been receiving less than the $500 per week will receive a payment to get them up to the $500\nThose who had been receiving more than the $500 per week will not have any money clawed back, but will receive the $500 per week flat rate from the time their claim is converted going forward\nThe weeks for which they collect the CERB will not impact the number of weeks of maternity and parental benefits they may receive\nThe maximum number of weeks of EI regular and maternity and standard parental benefits any claimant can receive is 50 weeks, or over a longer period for claimants who choose the extended parental benefits\nWhereas EI regular benefits count towards this 50-week maximum, CERB benefits do not\nIn all cases, maternity and parental benefits will be paid at the rate established under EI rules\nIf I am on maternity/parental benefits, am I eligible to apply for the CERB?\nYou cannot receive maternity or parental benefits at the same time as the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.\nIf you cannot return to work due to COVID-19 following your maternity/parental leave, you would be considered to have stopped working due to COVID-19. If you meet the other eligibility requirements you may receive the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.\nStudents/Apprentices\nAm I eligible for the CERB if I am a student who was working part-time and lost my job for reasons related to COVID-19?\nYes, provided you lost your job as a result of reasons related to COVID-19 and meet the other eligibility criteria.\nI lost my job but I am receiving bursaries and/or scholarships. Can I get the CERB?\nYes, provided you stopped working for reasons related to COVID-19 and meet the other eligibility criteria.\nStudent loans and bursaries do not affect eligibility for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.\nDoes the money I receive through bursaries and/or scholarships count toward the requirement for $5,000 in income?\nNo. Student loans and bursaries do not count toward the $5,000 in income.\nThe income of at least $5,000 may be from employment and/or self-employment. For those who are not eligible for Employment Insurance you may also include maternity and parental benefits under the Employment Insurance program and/or similar benefits paid in Quebec under the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan as part of the calculation for income.\nAm I eligible for the CERB if I am in an apprenticeship program, receiving funding through the Employment Insurance Program, and lose my job as a result of COVID-19?\nNo, but you could be eligible to continue receiving your Employment Insurance benefits.\nRetired persons\nAre people who lost their job but are receiving a pension eligible for the CERB?\nYes, provided you stopped working for reasons related to COVID-19 and meet the other eligibility criteria.\nPension income does not affect eligibility to the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.\nDoes pension income count towards the $5,000 income requirement for the CERB?\nNo. Pension income does not count toward the $5,000 in income.\nThe income of at least $5,000 may be from employment and/or self-employment. For those who are not eligible for Employment Insurance you may also include maternity and parental benefits under the Employment Insurance program and/or similar benefits paid in Quebec under the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan as part of the calculation for income.\nPersons with Disabilities\nCan I get the CERB if I am receiving disability benefits?\nYes, provided you stopped working for reasons related to COVID-19 and meet the other eligibility criteria.\nDisability benefits do not affect eligibility to the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.\nDoes the money I receive through my disability benefits count toward the requirement for $5,000 in income?\nNo. Funding received through disability benefits does not count toward the $5,000 in income.\nThe income of at least $5,000 may be from employment and/or self-employment.

Am I eligible for the CERB?\nYou may be eligible if you have stopped working because of COVID-19.\nWhen submitting your first claim, you cannot have earned more than $1,000 in employment and/or self-employment income for a period of at least 14 or more consecutive days within the 4-week benefit period of your claim.\nWhen submitting subsequent claims, you cannot have earned more than $1,000 in employment and/or self-employment income for the entire 4-week benefit period of your new claim.\nSelf-employed and Independent Workers\nAre self-employed small business owners eligible for the CERB?\nYes provided they meet the eligibility criteria including that they stopped working due to COVID-19 and do not earn more than $1,000 in a period of at least 14 consecutive days in the first benefit period and for the entire 4-week benefit period of any subsequent claim.\nSmall Business owners can receive income from their business in different ways, including as salary, business income or dividends. In determining their eligibility for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit:\nowners who take a salary from their business should consider their pre-tax salary\nowners who rely on business income should consider their net pre-tax income (gross income less expenses)\nowners who rely on dividend income should consider this as self-employment income provided it comes from non \u2013eligible dividends (generally, those paid out of corporate income taxed at the small business rate)\nCan someone qualify for CERB if they still have a small amount of income coming into their business account as a sole proprietor to pay some of their business expenses (commercial rent, utility costs, etc.) as long as they are not paying themselves any income from the business?\nYes.

Continue completing reports when they\u2019re due to continue to be paid for the duration of your claim.\nWhere can I find my Access Code to allow me to apply for EI online through Service Canada?\nYou do not need an access code to apply for EI. The EI Access Code is required for you to complete your biweekly reporting required once you have submitted your EI application. Shortly after you submit your EI application, an EI benefit statement will be mailed to you. This does not mean that your application has been approved. Your Benefit statement will provide the information you need to complete your reports with our Internet reporting service or our Telephone reporting service.\nYour access code is the 4-digit code printed in the shaded area of your benefit statement. Your access code is used to identify you and ensure confidentiality of the information you provide. Store your access code in a safe place, separately from your Social Insurance Number.\nDo I get a choice between collecting the EI CERB and collecting EI regular Benefits?\nThere are 3 possible scenarios in terms of which benefit you may receive:\nif you became eligible for Employment Insurance regular or sickness benefits prior to March 15th, you will receive the Employment Insurance benefits. You do not get to choose to receive the Canada Emergency Response Benefit\nif you became eligible for Employment Insurance regular or sickness benefits March 15th onward, you will receive the Canada Emergency Response Benefit. You do not get to choose\nThe only case where you get a choice is if you started a new EI claim within the last 52 weeks and there are still weeks payable on that claim. If you are in this situation, you can choose to:\nautomatically reactive (renew) your existing claim at the existing benefit rate, or\nrequest that Service Canada end your existing claim and open a new claim for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, provided you meet the eligibility criteria\nIf you choose to end your existing claim, any remaining weeks payable on that existing claim will be lost and your decision is irreversible and not subject to reconsideration.\nYou cannot get Employment Insurance benefits and the Canada Emergency Response Benefit for the same period.\nI am a seasonal worker who received EI regular benefits over the off-season and I have just exhausted my benefit entitlement, but I am unable to find work due to COVID-19\u2014am I eligible for the CERB?\nYes. You are eligible for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit if you are a former Employment Insurance claimant who used up your entitlement to your Employment Insurance regular benefits between December 29, 2019 and October 3, 2020, and are unable to find work due to COVID-19.\nThe date for which you would potentially become eligible for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit would be the week following your last Employment Insurance benefit payment or March 15, 2020, whichever is most recent. You may not receive EI benefits and the Canada Emergency Response Benefit for the same period.\nI was laid-off from my work prior to March 15, 2020 for reasons not related to COVID-19 and I have exhausted my EI regular benefits, but I am unable to find work due to COVID-19\u2014am I eligible for the CERB?\nYes. You are eligible for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit if you are a former Employment Insurance claimant who used up your entitlement to your Employment Insurance regular benefits between December 29, 2019 and October 3, 2020, and are unable to find work due to COVID-19.\nThe date for which you would potentially become eligible for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit would be the week following your last Employment Insurance benefit payment or March 15, 2020, whichever is most recent. You may not receive EI benefits and the Canada Emergency Response Benefit for the same period.\nAre individuals who are part of work-sharing agreements eligible for the CERB?\nNo. Individuals who are part of work-sharing agreements are not eligible as you cannot be getting Employment Insurance Benefits and the Canada Emergency Response Benefit at the same time.\nEmployers and workers can continue to enter into Work-Sharing agreements. The Canada Emergency Response Benefit has no impact on claims subject to Work-Sharing agreements. These claims continue to be processed using the standard rules for calculating Work-Sharing benefits.\nAre individuals who are working while on claim eligible for the CERB if they lose their jobs for reasons related to COVID-19?\nYou cannot be paid Employment Insurance benefits as part of working while on claim and the Canada Emergency Response Benefit for the same period.\nHowever, if you lose your job for reasons related to COVID-19 you will no longer be eligible for working while on claim. You may be eligible for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit provided you meet the eligibility criteria.\nI am a fisher who received Employment Insurance fishing benefits over the off-season and I have just exhausted my benefit entitlement, but I am unable to find work due to COVID-19\u2014am I eligible for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit?\nIf a self-employed fisher does not meet the criteria to establish a new EI fishing benefits claim, or if they have exhausted their EI fishing benefits between December 29, 2019 and October 3, 2020, and are unable to work due to COVID-19, they may be eligible for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, provided they meet the eligibility criteria.\nYou may not receive Employment Insurance benefits (including fishing benefits) and the Canada Emergency Response Benefit for the same period.\nCan employers use a Supplemental Unemployment Benefit (SUB) plan to increase their employee\u2019s weekly earnings while they are unemployed and collecting the Canada Emergency Response Benefit?\nGiven the simplified design of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), the provisions that exist under the Employment Insurance (EI) system for employers to make additional payments to workers through SUB plans do not apply to employees who are receiving the CERB. However, eligible individuals collecting the CERB and receiving $2,000 for a 4-week period may earn up to $1,000 in employment and/or self-employment income in each of their benefit periods from March 15, 2020 to October 3, 2020 while continuing to receive the CERB. This represents 50% of the amount of the benefit. Employers who wish to increase their employees weekly earnings while they are unemployed have the flexibility to top-up CERB benefits up to this amount in lieu of a SUB plan. However, individuals who receive income from employment, including top-ups, in excess of $1,000 over each 4-week period for which they claim the CERB would have to repay CERB amounts they received for the same benefit period.\nEmployers that wish to do so may continue to submit a SUB plan to Service Canada.

By starting this application, you consent to the terms of the privacy notice statement.

You can't receive these benefits more than 17 weeks after your due date or the date you gave birth, whichever is later. A maximum of 15 weeks of benefits is available.\nWhen you apply for maternity benefits, you can also apply for parental benefits. This will save you time later.\nParental benefits\nYou can start receiving parental benefits the week your child is born or placed with you for the purpose of adoption.\nWhen applying for parental benefits, you need to choose between 2 options:\nstandard parental (up to 35 weeks, up to $638 a week)\nextended parental (up to 61 weeks, up to $383 a week)\nIf you applied for parental benefits at the same time as maternity benefits, you don't need to apply again.\nOnce you start receiving parental benefits, you can't change options.\nSharing parental benefits\nIf sharing benefits, each parent must choose the same option, standard or extended. Each parent must submit their own application. If parents don't choose the same option, the choice on the first application received is used to determine the parental benefit option for all parents.\nWhen sharing, the maximum number of weeks available increases to:\n40 weeks for standard parental\n69 weeks for extended parental\nOne parent can't receive more than 35 weeks of standard or 61 weeks of extended parental benefits. The remaining 5 weeks of standard or 8 weeks of extended parental benefits are available on a use-it-or-lose-it basis: if taken, they can only be taken by the other parent(s).\nParents can receive their weeks of benefits at the same time or one after another.\nExamples\nMaternity plus standard parental benefits\nJulie and David are having a baby. Julie takes the full 15 weeks of maternity benefits she is entitled to. She and David each decide to take 20 weeks of standard parental benefits at the same time to care for their child.\nExtended parental benefits\nSami and Alex are adopting a child.

The amount you receive depends on your insurable earnings* before taxes in the past 52 weeks or since the start of your last claim, whichever is shorter.\n* Insurable earnings include most of the different types of compensation from employment, such as wages, tips, bonuses and commissions. The Canada Revenue Agency determines what types of earnings are insurable.\nSome employers provide additional money to employees on maternity or parental leave. This is called a top-up. Check with your employer to find out if they offer a top-up.\nIf your weekly earnings vary or your income changes\nTo calculate your benefit amount, we use a specific number of your highest paid weeks of employment. We call these your best weeks. The number of best weeks we use is based on the unemployment rate where you live. It could be between 14 and 22 weeks.\nIf your weekly earnings vary or your income changes, your best weeks can impact your benefit amount.\nEstimate your benefits\nAnswer the questions below to estimate your benefits, or find out what we use to calculate your benefits.\nFind your economic region to learn how many best weeks are used to calculate your benefit amount. To complete your estimate, you need to know your average insurable earnings (before taxes) for those weeks.

In 2023, the maximum amount is $390 a week.\nBenefit calculation\nThis is how we calculate your weekly benefit amount:\nwe add your insurable weekly earnings from your best weeks based on information provided by you and your record of employment\nwe divide that amount by the number of best weeks based on where you live\nwe then multiply the result by 55% for maternity and standard parental benefits or by 33% for extended parental benefits\nIf your family income is $25,921 or less\nYou may be eligible to receive the family supplement if:\nyour annual net family income is $25,921 or less\nyou have at least 1 child under 18\nyou or your spouse receive the Canada Child Benefit\nWe automatically add your family supplement to your weekly benefit payments.

Financial Services; and\n2. Insurance Services.\nFinancial Services oversees Financial Planning, Financial Counselling and Education Programs whereas;\nInsurance Services oversees:\nThe administration and service delivery of insurance products for serving CAF members as well as retired members, including transferability options.\nIt also oversees coverage for Accidental Dismemberment for both Service and Non-Service Attributable injuries\nThe primary focus of this presentation will be on Insurance Services, under which you will also find the CAF LTD and CAF VRP that are both fully administered by Manulife.\nThe CAF LTD oversees the adjudication of LTD files, the setup of LTD benefits and the administration of Client medical reviews and;\nThe CAF VRP oversees services available to eligible CAF Members in areas such as: client evaluations, employment assistance and vocational retraining.\nThis slide shows an overview of time lines for accessing CAF VRP services as well as what services are available to Members as they go through the release process.\nOn average, transition from the time of injury and/or illness to the date of release can take more than two years. This provides valuable time to begin early planning and exploration regarding choices and decisions as they relate to vocational plans through the CAF VRP.\n\nDuring this initial time frame, as a serving member, you will have access to our Counsellors who can help with any \u201cwhat if scenarios\u201d.\u00a0 They will provide general information on supports available through both the CAF LTD and the CAF VRP.\u00a0 Counsellors are available to discuss training plans or programs Members may be exploring, and review any other questions they may have regarding our services and supports.\n\nCounsellors cannot approve funding for any program until such time as a file has been pre-approved for CAF LTD, which means your application and attending physicians statement has been received and processed so the referral to the CAF VRP can be completed. Regardless, our Counsellors are more than happy to have early conversations with you in order to help guide you on your vocational decision in preparation for your eventual release.\n\nCAF LTD applications may be pre-approved before release and once pre-approved, it may be referred to the CAF VRP.\u00a0 Support for CAF VRP funding and allowances may be provided for approved programs up to six(6) months prior to the Members effective date of release.\nThis means, if your CAF VRP training program is approved and you have an approved CAF Vocational Rehabilitation Program for Serving Members (VRPSM), you may attend a secondary institution or an unpaid full time or part time on the job training (OJT) with an employer of choice, up to six(6) months prior to your date of release, as a serving CAF member and be in receipt of your pay and benefits.\nThe CAF LTD benefit eligibility begins at the effective date of release and continues up to 24 months post the effective date of release, and possibly beyond age 65 should the Member meet the definition of Total Disability (TD) \u2013 (refer to slide 9 for the definition of TD).\n\nIt is important for the Member to ensure they do not delay submitting their application for CAF LTD benefits.\u00a0 It is recommended Members submit their application as soon as they receive their Disclosure from DCSA.\nMembers who reside in Canada will have access to provincial Health Care plans for the province in which they reside.\nUpon release, access to medical support will depend on the number of years served.\u00a0 For example:\nIf you served more than 10 years, you will have automatic access to the Public Service Health Care Plan (PSHCP).\nIf you served less than 10 years, you will need to apply to Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC) for access to the VAC sponsored Public Service Health Care Plan.\u00a0 It is important to note that there is no dental coverage under this plan and there is a mandatory 60 day wait with no extended medical coverage.\n\nFor any injuries and illnesses approved through VAC, you are encouraged to contact VAC directly to discuss what services and supports that may be available to you.\nThe following is an overview of eligibility requirements for CAF LTD benefits.\nFor Regular Force Members:\nCoverage is in place 24/7;\nThe injury does not have to be attributable to service and/or related to duty; and\nThe CAF LTD benefit is based on your salary at the time of release.\nFor Reserve Force Members, coverage is determined by the following:\nMembers on a Class A or Class B contract, less than 180 Days, the injury must while on duty;\nMembers on Class B contracts, more than 180 Days, or who are Class C, the coverage is in place 24/7 and the injury does not have to be attributable to duty; and\nThe CAF LTD benefit is based on salary and type of contract or Class at the date of release.\nIn order to access CAF LTD Benefits, CAF Members must ensure they provide the appropriate documentation.\nNon Medical Releases:\nMembers being released for any reason other than medical (For example, Voluntary Release (Item 4A) or Services no longer required (Item 5F) may qualify for CAF LTD benefits as well as have access to supports through the CAF VRP.\nMembers must submit their application directly to SISIP within 120 days of their date of release.\nThe adjudication for non medical releases will be based on the definition of Total Disability (TD).\nMedical Releases (Items 3A or 3B):\nIt is recommended Members submit their application at Disclosure, which is anywhere from 7 to 12 months in advance of the date of release.\nThe Member will have a Projected DOR provided with their Disclosure package which may adjust depending on circumstances.\u00a0 The Member will be required to provide a Projected DOR as a part of the application.\nThe CAF LTD Claims Department will require 3 key pieces of information to complete the review and approval of a file:\nThe Member\u2019s Statement (APP)\nThe Attending Physician Statement (APS)\nConfirmation, from DCSA through SISIP Ottawa , regarding the official Date of Release\nIt is very important to remember if a medical release is in progress, you are cautioned against choosing an early voluntary release. Electing an early voluntary release may negatively impact the supports available to you as the CAF LTD benefit is adjudicated based on the release item on file at the date of release.\u00a0 Even in cases where the release item is changed post release, the CAF LTD benefit approval is still based on the release item on file on the date of release.\nIf this situation applies to you as the listener, please discuss this with your CAF Case Manager or contact a member from our team to further review the implications this may have on your access to financial and program supports post release.\nCAF LTD Period of Benefit eligibility is determined as per the following:\nFor a Medical Release:\nMembers are eligible to receive CAF LTD benefits for 24 consecutive months from their effective date of release.\n\nDuring this period of eligibility, the CAF LTD Claims Department will conduct two medical reviews, 12 and 18 months after release.\u00a0 The paperwork for these reviews are to be completed by the Member\u2019s Family Physician and/or Specialist.\n\nCAF LTD benefits and supports through CAF VRP will continue beyond 24 months if the need exists and the Member meets the CAF LTD definition of Total Disability (TD).\n\nTotal Disability (TD) is determined based on education, training, experience and the medical condition at 24 months, which must be supported by providing required medical documentation to the CAF LTD Claims department.\n\nCAF LTD and access to CAF VRP may go to age 65 should a need exist.\nFor all other categories of Release:\nA file is initially adjudicated at the date of release based on the definition of Total Disability (TD).\n\nThe benefit in this category may also go to age 65 should a need exist.\nThe previous slide outlined CAF LTD benefit eligibility based on a definition of Total Disability (TD).\u00a0 In order for a Member to continue to receive CAF LTD benefits beyond 24 months, this is the definition they must meet:\nThe Member must \u201chave been released from the CAF and there is clear and objective medical evidence, which confirms that [they] are incapacitated by a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, which is preventing [them] from performing any and every duty of any substantially gainful occupation or employment for which [they] are qualified by education, training or experience.\u201d\nHere is an overview of the CAF LTD Benefit Income Amount:\nFor Regular Force Members the minimum income is equal to 75% of a Corporal\u2019s salary.\u00a0 The CAF LTD benefit is calculated at 75% of gross pay at date of release with offsets for CFSA pension, CPP/QPP, taxes, and employment income.\nFor Reserve Force Members serving on Class A or Class B contracts, under 180 days, the benefit is calculated based on a deemed salary of $2,700 per month, with optional higher amounts available at the discretion and cost of the Member.\nFor Reserve Force Members on a Class B long term or Class C contract, the minimum income is equal to 75% of a Corporal\u2019s salary. The CAF LTD benefit is calculated at 75% of monthly gross pay at the time of injury, with offsets similar to those for Regular Force Members.\nWhen calculating post release income, it is important to keep in mind that CAF gross pay is pay before any offsets for Pension contributions, EI, CPP, Mess dues, etc.\u00a0 Since Pension Contributions, EI, CPP and Mess dues are not taken off the CAF LTD, 75% of gross pay translates to about 87% of net pay.\nIn all cases, Members may qualify for additional income support with VAC as determined by their processes and requirements.\nThe objective of the CAF Vocational Rehabilitation Program, or CAF VRP:\nIs to help prepare Members for a return to employment post release.\u00a0 It is available to all Members who meet the eligibility requirements for CAF LTD benefits.\n\nIt can help by providing transition counseling, employment search assistance, and vocational retraining when required.\nIt is important for Members who are exploring options and putting vocational plans together to get their answers directly from the source and not rely on secondhand information.\u00a0 CAF VRP Counsellors are available to help explore available options, assist with future career exploration, help set goals and any vocational plans which may be required to achieve these goals.\nNote:\u00a0 Confirmation of the date of release must be received prior to CAF VRP approval for program funding.\nHere\u2019s a visual as to why it\u2019s important to speak with a CAF VRP Counsellor with respect to any plans you may be exploring for your upcoming release. CAF VRP Counsellors have the experience required to assist in making an informed decision. They know school programs and eligibility requirements and can often provide valuable insight with respect to the labor market in the region where you plan to reside after you release.\nWhile you may see a straight line and a smooth path to your goal, in reality there may be avoidable roadblocks, twists and turns which a CAF VRP Counsellor can help you navigate or avoid altogether.\u00a0 It\u2019s important to talk it through.\nHow much CAF VRP support time does a Member have?\u00a0 As discussed earlier, Members should submit their application at Disclosure, 7 to 9 months in advance of the date of release.\u00a0 Provided all documentation has been received, the CAF LTD file has been reviewed and approved, the file will be referred to the CAF VRP and Members may access CAF VRP financial support up to six(6) months prior to the effective date of release, which is the last day of paid CAF service.\nCAF VRP support continues as long as the CAF LTD approval is in place.\nWhat can Members expect regarding employment search assistance through the CAF VRP?\nAs part of the CAF VRP, Members have access to the Job Search Assistance Team (JST).\u00a0 The JST can help Members with resume writing and cover letters, as well as provide training on how to write their own resumes and cover letters.\u00a0 The JST can also help provide guidance and resume writing specific to accessing priority hiring.\u00a0 They can also provide coaching to Members regarding interview techniques, and provide monthly targeted employment leads.\nThrough the CAF VRP, Members may also have access to wage subsidies as an option to assist them in their transition to employment in the private sector.\n\nIt\u2019s important for Members to consider all their options before locking in to one thing without exploring other possibilities.\u00a0 Again, speaking with a CAF VRP Counsellor can help Members as they explore the options and possibilities available to them as they prepare for their release.\nWhat are the requirements for vocational support?\u00a0 In order for funding to be approved through the CAF VRP, there has to be a need for training.\nThe proposed plan has to make medical sense and not have any negative impact on the Member\u2019s overall health and well-being.\n\nWhen possible the training should build on existing skills.\n\nTraining under the CAF VRP is provided for only one program or direction.\u00a0 There may be exceptions to this, particularly in cases where two programs are linked closely together and wherein both are required as a condition of employment.\u00a0 An example of this might be a Member who is considering becoming a heavy equipment operator, and may also need a class 1 license as part of employment requirements.\n\nTraining must have realistic employment opportunities.\u00a0 It\u2019s important for Members to consider where they will be residing after release, and whether the labor market in that area has realistic employment opportunities for the training which they plan to pursue.\u00a0 This is where a CAF VRP Counsellor can provide valuable feedback with respect to employment opportunities, employment statistics based on training program completion and emerging trends in both the public and private employment sectors.\n\nIn order for funding to be approved for a training program, the training must provide a License, Certificate, Diploma, or Degree from a recognized training institution or facility.\n\nAnd last but not least, the training must give good value.\nWhat is covered for funding through the CAF VRP?\u00a0 Support is provided on a case by case basis, as needed, for program funding, allowances and educational supports.\nFor program funding the CAF VRP will cover 100% of mandatory tuition and books for approved programs.\n\nThe CAF VRP will provide allowances to assist with items such as travel, internet and supplies.\u00a0 Under certain conditions, a dual residency allowance may also be available if the approved training program is not offered near the Member\u2019s primary place of residence.\u00a0 Allowances to assist with child care may also be available, at a cost share of 50% of submitted receipts to a monthly maximum.\n\nUnder the CAF VRP, educational supports in terms of funding for tutoring may be provided if required, as well as funding for mandatory safety equipment as part of an approved training program.\u00a0 Interest-free loans may also be available should they be required for the purchase of technical equipment directly related to the approved training.\u00a0 Computers or the purchase of tools specific to training programs are examples of what might be supported.\n\nAdditional supports may also be available and can be evaluated on a case by case basis.\nTo finish up we\u2019d like to leave you with these final thoughts.\nFirst, there is life after the Canadian Armed Forces.\u00a0 While we recognize the unknown can be scary, rest assured there is a team

and should you have any questions regarding the CAF VRP, we are located across Canada and can provide support in both official languages.\u00a0 On this slide, you will see our toll free numbers for our regions across Canada.\n\nIf your question is specific to the CAF LTD benefit, please contact our Claims Department at 1-(800)-565-0701 or you may also visit our web site at www.sisip.com.\nBest of luck as you embark on your transition and we look forward to working with you.\nDownload video (.mp4 42.8 MB)\nThe following is an overview of the Canadian Armed Forces Long Term Disability (CAF LTD) benefit and the Canadian Armed Forces Vocational Rehabilitation Program (CAF VRP).\nSISIP is an integral part of the CAF transition process.\u00a0 We work very closely with a variety of civilian and military agencies, groups and service partners in the development of viable opportunities, plans and support to help prepare members for release and an eventual return to gainful employment.\nThere are two components to SISIP Financial Services:\n1. Financial Services; and\n2. Insurance Services.\nFinancial Services oversees Financial Planning, Financial Counselling and Education Programs whereas;\nInsurance Services oversees:\nThe administration and service delivery of insurance products for serving CAF members as well as retired members, including transferability options.\nIt also oversees coverage for Accidental Dismemberment for both Service and Non-Service Attributable injuries\nThe primary focus of this presentation will be on Insurance Services, under which you will also find the CAF LTD and CAF VRP that are both fully administered by Manulife.\nThe CAF LTD oversees the adjudication of LTD files, the setup of LTD benefits and the administration of Client medical reviews and;\nThe CAF VRP oversees services available to eligible CAF Members in areas such as: client evaluations, employment assistance and vocational retraining.\nThis slide shows an overview of time lines for accessing CAF VRP services as well as what services are available to Members as they go through the release process.\nOn average, transition from the time of injury and/or illness to the date of release can take more than two years. This provides valuable time to begin early planning and exploration regarding choices and decisions as they relate to vocational plans through the CAF VRP.\n\nDuring this initial time frame, as a serving member, you will have access to our Counsellors who can help with any \u201cwhat if scenarios\u201d.\u00a0 They will provide general information on supports available through both the CAF LTD and the CAF VRP.\u00a0 Counsellors are available to discuss training plans or programs Members may be exploring, and review any other questions they may have regarding our services and supports.\n\nCounsellors cannot approve funding for any program until such time as a file has been pre-approved for CAF LTD, which means your application and attending physicians statement has been received and processed so the referral to the CAF VRP can be completed. Regardless, our Counsellors are more than happy to have early conversations with you in order to help guide you on your vocational decision in preparation for your eventual release.\n\nCAF LTD applications may be pre-approved before release and once pre-approved, it may be referred to the CAF VRP.\u00a0 Support for CAF VRP funding and allowances may be provided for approved programs up to six(6) months prior to the Members effective date of release.\nThis means, if your CAF VRP training program is approved and you have an approved CAF Vocational Rehabilitation Program for Serving Members (VRPSM), you may attend a secondary institution or an unpaid full time or part time on the job training (OJT) with an employer of choice, up to six(6) months prior to your date of release, as a serving CAF member and be in receipt of your pay and benefits.\nThe CAF LTD benefit eligibility begins at the effective date of release and continues up to 24 months post the effective date of release, and possibly beyond age 65 should the Member meet the definition of Total Disability (TD) \u2013 (refer to slide 9 for the definition of TD).\n\nIt is important for the Member to ensure they do not delay submitting their application for CAF LTD benefits.\u00a0 It is recommended Members submit their application as soon as they receive their Disclosure from DCSA.\nMembers who reside in Canada will have access to provincial Health Care plans for the province in which they reside.\nUpon release, access to medical support will depend on the number of years served.\u00a0 For example:\nIf you served more than 10 years, you will have automatic access to the Public Service Health Care Plan (PSHCP).\nIf you served less than 10 years, you will need to apply to Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC) for access to the VAC sponsored Public Service Health Care Plan.\u00a0 It is important to note that there is no dental coverage under this plan and there is a mandatory 60 day wait with no extended medical coverage.\n\nFor any injuries and illnesses approved through VAC, you are encouraged to contact VAC directly to discuss what services and supports that may be available to you.\nThe following is an overview of eligibility requirements for CAF LTD benefits.\nFor Regular Force Members:\nCoverage is in place 24/7;\nThe injury does not have to be attributable to service and/or related to duty; and\nThe CAF LTD benefit is based on your salary at the time of release.\nFor Reserve Force Members, coverage is determined by the following:\nMembers on a Class A or Class B contract, less than 180 Days, the injury must while on duty;\nMembers on Class B contracts, more than 180 Days, or who are Class C, the coverage is in place 24/7 and the injury does not have to be attributable to duty; and\nThe CAF LTD benefit is based on salary and type of contract or Class at the date of release.\nIn order to access CAF LTD Benefits, CAF Members must ensure they provide the appropriate documentation.\nNon Medical Releases:\nMembers being released for any reason other than medical (For example, Voluntary Release (Item 4A) or Services no longer required (Item 5F) may qualify for CAF LTD benefits as well as have access to supports through the CAF VRP.\nMembers must submit their application directly to SISIP within 120 days of their date of release.\nThe adjudication for non medical releases will be based on the definition of Total Disability (TD).\nMedical Releases (Items 3A or 3B):\nIt is recommended Members submit their application at Disclosure, which is anywhere from 7 to 12 months in advance of the date of release.\nThe Member will have a Projected DOR provided with their Disclosure package which may adjust depending on circumstances.\u00a0 The Member will be required to provide a Projected DOR as a part of the application.\nThe CAF LTD Claims Department will require 3 key pieces of information to complete the review and approval of a file:\nThe Member\u2019s Statement (APP)\nThe Attending Physician Statement (APS)\nConfirmation, from DCSA through SISIP Ottawa , regarding the official Date of Release\nIt is very important to remember if a medical release is in progress, you are cautioned against choosing an early voluntary release. Electing an early voluntary release may negatively impact the supports available to you as the CAF LTD benefit is adjudicated based on the release item on file at the date of release.\u00a0 Even in cases where the release item is changed post release, the CAF LTD benefit approval is still based on the release item on file on the date of release.\nIf this situation applies to you as the listener, please discuss this with your CAF Case Manager or contact a member from our team to further review the implications this may have on your access to financial and program supports post release.\nCAF LTD Period of Benefit eligibility is determined as per the following:\nFor a Medical Release:\nMembers are eligible to receive CAF LTD benefits for 24 consecutive months from their effective date of release.\n\nDuring this period of eligibility, the CAF LTD Claims Department will conduct two medical reviews, 12 and 18 months after release.\u00a0 The paperwork for these reviews are to be completed by the Member\u2019s Family Physician and/or Specialist.\n\nCAF LTD benefits and supports through CAF VRP will continue beyond 24 months if the need exists and the Member meets the CAF LTD definition of Total Disability (TD).\n\nTotal Disability (TD) is determined based on education, training, experience and the medical condition at 24 months, which must be supported by providing required medical documentation to the CAF LTD Claims department.\n\nCAF LTD and access to CAF VRP may go to age 65 should a need exist.\nFor all other categories of Release:\nA file is initially adjudicated at the date of release based on the definition of Total Disability (TD).\n\nThe benefit in this category may also go to age 65 should a need exist.\nThe previous slide outlined CAF LTD benefit eligibility based on a definition of Total Disability (TD).\u00a0 In order for a Member to continue to receive CAF LTD benefits beyond 24 months, this is the definition they must meet:\nThe Member must \u201chave been released from the CAF and there is clear and objective medical evidence, which confirms that [they] are incapacitated by a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, which is preventing [them] from performing any and every duty of any substantially gainful occupation or employment for which [they] are qualified by education, training or experience.\u201d\nHere is an overview of the CAF LTD Benefit Income Amount:\nFor Regular Force Members the minimum income is equal to 75% of a Corporal\u2019s salary.\u00a0 The CAF LTD benefit is calculated at 75% of gross pay at date of release with offsets for CFSA pension, CPP/QPP, taxes, and employment income.\nFor Reserve Force Members serving on Class A or Class B contracts, under 180 days, the benefit is calculated based on a deemed salary of $2,700 per month, with optional higher amounts available at the discretion and cost of the Member.\nFor Reserve Force Members on a Class B long term or Class C contract, the minimum income is equal to 75% of a Corporal\u2019s salary. The CAF LTD benefit is calculated at 75% of monthly gross pay at the time of injury, with offsets similar to those for Regular Force Members.\nWhen calculating post release income, it is important to keep in mind that CAF gross pay is pay before any offsets for Pension contributions, EI, CPP, Mess dues, etc.\u00a0 Since Pension Contributions, EI, CPP and Mess dues are not taken off the CAF LTD, 75% of gross pay translates to about 87% of net pay.\nIn all cases, Members may qualify for additional income support with VAC as determined by their processes and requirements.\nThe objective of the CAF Vocational Rehabilitation Program, or CAF VRP:\nIs to help prepare Members for a return to employment post release.\u00a0 It is available to all Members who meet the eligibility requirements for CAF LTD benefits.\n\nIt can help by providing transition counseling, employment search assistance, and vocational retraining when required.\nIt is important for Members who are exploring options and putting vocational plans together to get their answers directly from the source and not rely on secondhand information.\u00a0 CAF VRP Counsellors are available to help explore available options, assist with future career exploration, help set goals and any vocational plans which may be required to achieve these goals.\nNote:\u00a0 Confirmation of the date of release must be received prior to CAF VRP approval for program funding.\nHere\u2019s a visual as to why it\u2019s important to speak with a CAF VRP Counsellor with respect to any plans you may be exploring for your upcoming release. CAF VRP Counsellors have the experience required to assist in making an informed decision. They know school programs and eligibility requirements and can often provide valuable insight with respect to the labor market in the region where you plan to reside after you release.\nWhile you may see a straight line and a smooth path to your goal, in reality there may be avoidable roadblocks, twists and turns which a CAF VRP Counsellor can help you navigate or avoid altogether.\u00a0 It\u2019s important to talk it through.\nHow much CAF VRP support time does a Member have?\u00a0 As discussed earlier, Members should submit their application at Disclosure, 7 to 9 months in advance of the date of release.\u00a0 Provided all documentation has been received, the CAF LTD file has been reviewed and approved, the file will be referred to the CAF VRP and Members may access CAF VRP financial support up to six(6) months prior to the effective date of release, which is the last day of paid CAF service.\nCAF VRP support continues as long as the CAF LTD approval is in place.\nWhat can Members expect regarding employment search assistance through the CAF VRP?\nAs part of the CAF VRP, Members have access to the Job Search Assistance Team (JST).\u00a0 The JST can help Members with resume writing and cover letters, as well as provide training on how to write their own resumes and cover letters.\u00a0 The JST can also help provide guidance and resume writing specific to accessing priority hiring.\u00a0 They can also provide coaching to Members regarding interview techniques, and provide monthly targeted employment leads.\nThrough the CAF VRP, Members may also have access to wage subsidies as an option to assist them in their transition to employment in the private sector.\n\nIt\u2019s important for Members to consider all their options before locking in to one thing without exploring other possibilities.\u00a0 Again, speaking with a CAF VRP Counsellor can help Members as they explore the options and possibilities available to them as they prepare for their release.\nWhat are the requirements for vocational support?\u00a0 In order for funding to be approved through the CAF VRP, there has to be a need for training.\nThe proposed plan has to make medical sense and not have any negative impact on the Member\u2019s overall health and well-being.\n\nWhen possible the training should build on existing skills.\n\nTraining under the CAF VRP is provided for only one program or direction.\u00a0 There may be exceptions to this, particularly in cases where two programs are linked closely together and wherein both are required as a condition of employment.\u00a0 An example of this might be a Member who is considering becoming a heavy equipment operator, and may also need a class 1 license as part of employment requirements.\n\nTraining must have realistic employment opportunities.\u00a0 It\u2019s important for Members to consider where they will be residing after release, and whether the labor market in that area has realistic employment opportunities for the training which they plan to pursue.\u00a0 This is where a CAF VRP Counsellor can provide valuable feedback with respect to employment opportunities, employment statistics based on training program completion and emerging trends in both the public and private employment sectors.\n\nIn order for funding to be approved for a training program, the training must provide a License, Certificate, Diploma, or Degree from a recognized training institution or facility.\n\nAnd last but not least, the training must give good value.\nWhat is covered for funding through the CAF VRP?\u00a0 Support is provided on a case by case basis, as needed, for program funding, allowances and educational supports.\nFor program funding the CAF VRP will cover 100% of mandatory tuition and books for approved programs.\n\nThe CAF VRP will provide allowances to assist with items such as travel, internet and supplies.\u00a0 Under certain conditions, a dual residency allowance may also be available if the approved training program is not offered near the Member\u2019s primary place of residence.\u00a0 Allowances to assist with child care may also be available, at a cost share of 50% of submitted receipts to a monthly maximum.\n\nUnder the CAF VRP, educational supports in terms of funding for tutoring may be provided if required, as well as funding for mandatory safety equipment as part of an approved training program.\u00a0 Interest-free loans may also be available should they be required for the purchase of technical equipment directly related to the approved training.\u00a0 Computers or the purchase of tools specific to training programs are examples of what might be supported.\n\nAdditional supports may also be available and can be evaluated on a case by case basis.\nTo finish up we\u2019d like to leave you with these final thoughts.\nFirst, there is life after the Canadian Armed Forces.\u00a0 While we recognize the unknown can be scary, rest assured there is a team of experienced CAF VRP Counsellors, knowledgeable agencies and Service Providers who are ready and available to help you as you transition to this next important phase.\n\nSecond, remember short-term decisions can have long-term consequences.\u00a0 Don\u2019t be afraid to reach out to the subject matter experts who are ready and available to help you as you begin to explore your options.\n\nLast, and most importantly, you are now your own career manager, accept the responsibility wisely.\u00a0 Make informed decisions which will set you up for long term success.\nDon\u2019t Forget - all CAF members with an approved CAF VRP remain a member of the CAF until your effective Date of Release.\u00a0 As such, you are still responsive to your respective Chain of Commands.\nThank you for your time and should you have any questions regarding the CAF VRP, we are located across Canada and can provide support in both official languages.\u00a0 On this slide, you will see our toll free numbers for

After you apply\n2.\u00a0Who is eligible\nYou may apply to live in military\u00a0housing if you are:\na regular Canadian Armed Forces member posted to a new location or already living in the area\na Reserve Force member working full-time and at least on a 6-month contract\na foreign military/exchange member\na Government of Canada civilian indeterminate employee working in support of the Department of National Defence\na Royal Canadian Mounted Police employee\na Military Family Resource Centre employee or Canadian Forces\u00a0Morale and Welfare Services\u00a0employee (CANEX, SISIP Financial Services, and Personnel Support Programs) working at least 27.5 hours per week\nan indeterminate employee of other Government of Canada departments\na Department of National Defence contractor on contract over 6 months\nHousehold size\nYour military records will detail household size.\u00a0We will use this to determine the size of housing that may be assigned (based on priority and availability). We follow the household size indicated on your posting instruction or the household size indicated by your Orderly Room if your posting instructions were issued\u00a0more than a year ago. We are not required to assign a housing unit that is larger than that is warranted by your record\u2019s household size but we can in some circumstances where there is availability.\nIf you are a Priority 3 applicant, you do not need to provide a confirmation of household size because you will be offered any unit that is surplus to Priority 1 and 2 needs, and size will not be considered.\nApplicants with special needs\nThere are homes that have been modified to meet the needs of occupants with disabilities at most housing locations. Existing housing and barrier-free housing needs are dealt with on a case-by-case basis. Please contact the local Housing Services Centre to talk about your requirements.\nSingle members\nAs a single member, you may apply to live in military housing and you will be considered using the same priority system as all other applicants.\nMembers on imposed restrictions\nIf you are on or are about to proceed on imposed restrictions, you may apply to live in military housing. You will be considered as a Priority 1 applicant and a household of one.\nOnce your imposed restrictions status has been lifted and your family and furniture have been moved at government expense, you must reapply for housing and your application will be considered as a Priority 1.\nShort-term occupancy\nIt is possible to apply for short-term or interim occupancy (minimum of 60 days). These housing offers are possible at the discretion of the\u00a0Housing Services\u00a0Centre\u00a0manager. These types of allocations do not involve regular preparations (e.g. painting, floor refinishing, etc.) but meet all health and safety standards.\nNon-family members\nIt is possible for you to share your housing unit with non-family members. However, since we do not \u201capprove\u201d unofficial household members, we are not required to allocate housing that is any larger than necessary based on your official household size, as indicated on your posting instructions or as indicated by your Orderly Room if your posting instructions were issued\u00a0more than a year ago. We may allocate a larger house based on availability.\nWaiting lists\nWhen the number of applicants exceeds the available DND housing, we create a waiting list, by priority, for each housing size. We will only allocate Priority 2 after the Priority 1 list has been exhausted. We will only allocate Priority 3 after both the Priority 1 and Priority 2 lists have been exhausted.\nYour Change of Strength date and the date on the Application for Department of National Defence Housing form will determine the placement and order on the waiting lists.\nWhile you are on the waiting list, we will:\nNotify you of the availability of housing as soon as possible, but no later than 60 days before your Change of Strength date.\nGive you an estimated date of availability of a unit that meets your needs.\nNotify you that you have 30 days after\u00a0your reporting date to confirm your application with us and that failure to do so will result in your removal from the waiting list.\nIf you refuse a housing offer and decide to reapply, your new application will be dated as of the date the refused unit would have been available for occupancy or as of the date of your new application (whichever is later).\nYou can choose to remove your name from the waiting list by contacting us. We will remove you from the waiting list automatically\u00a0if:\nYou do not respond to an offer within 72 hours.\nYou confirm opting for private accommodations.\nYou do not confirm your application with us within 30 days of your reporting date.\nReleasing from the Canadian Armed Forces\nYou can apply to stay in your unit past your date of release if you are eligible to move to an Intended Place of Residence, or if you are enrolled in an approved career transition or training program.\nIf you wish to request an occupancy extension, you must submit it in writing, including a copy of your release message confirming your Intended Place of Residence eligibility or your enrolment in an approved career or transition training program. Extensions may be authorized based on the availability of housing units and at the discretion of the\u00a0Housing Services Centre\u00a0manager.\nIf you wish to extend the existing occupancy agreement past your date of release, and you are not eligible to move to an Intended Place of Residence and you are not enrolled in an approved career transition or training program, you may be eligible for a short extension at our discretion.\nContact us for help\nCanadian Forces Housing Agency\nMore information\nOccupant handbook\nLicence to occupy\nResponsible pet ownership Instruction in DND residential housing\nDAOD 5024-0 - DND Living Accommodation\nDocument navigation\nPrevious - Apply for military housing: Step 1.

Definitions\nconflict of duties (t\u00e2ches conflictuelles)\nA conflict that arises, not because of a DND employee\u2019s or CF member\u2019s private interests, but as a result of one or more concurrent or competing official responsibilities. For example, responsibilities associated with their primary official duties compete with their responsibilities in a role outside of DND or the CF, such as an appointment to a board of directors, or other outside function, when that role is also part of his or her official duties. (Department of National Defence and Canadian Forces Code of Values and Ethics)\nforeign source (source \u00e9trang\u00e8re)\nA foreign sovereign, state or functionary. (Defence Terminology Bank record number 43075)\norganizational conflict of interest (conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats organisationnel)\nA situation in which the action or decision of a DND employee or CF member calls into question the integrity, objectivity, impartiality or non-partisanship of the DND or the CF. As a result, the situation could be perceived by a reasonable observer as placing the DND or the CF in a conflict of interest with the public interest. A real organizational conflict of interest is defined as existing at the present time in a situation; an apparent organizational conflict of interest could be perceived by a reasonable person to exist in the situation, whether or not it is the case; and a potential organizational conflict of interest could reasonably be foreseen to exist in the future. An apparent organizational conflict of interest is just as serious as a real or potential organizational conflict of interest. (Department of National Defence and Canadian Forces Code of Values and Ethics)\npersonal conflict of interest (conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats personnel)\nA situation in which a DND employee or CF member has private interests that are not an integral part of their public role and that could improperly influence the performance of his or her official duties and responsibilities or in which the DND employee or CF member uses his or her office for personal gain. A real conflict of interest is defined as existing at the present time in a situation; an apparent conflict of interest could be perceived by a reasonable observer to exist in a situation, whether or not it is the case; and a potential conflict of interest could reasonably be foreseen to exist in the future. Conflicts of interest may arise in the following circumstances: outside activities (including political activities); acceptance of gifts, hospitality and other benefits; post-employment activities; and any other activity or decision incompatible with the official duties and responsibilities of a DND employee or a CF member. An apparent personal conflict of interest is just as serious as a real or potential personal conflict of interest. (Department of National Defence and Canadian Forces Code of Values and Ethics)\n3. Overview\nGeneral\n3.1 It is often business or diplomatic practice to offer gifts, hospitality and other benefits to customers, potential customers or foreign representatives. The DND and the CAF are affected by such business or diplomatic practice since it is a major purchaser of goods and services and a significant player in the international sphere. DND employees and CAF members may be beneficiaries of such gifts, hospitality or other benefits, which may create a conflict of interest (COI) or potential for adverse public perception. Such benefits may range from a promotional item of minimal value such as a calendar, mug, pen or T-shirt to, in the case of a gift from a foreign source, a cultural article, figurine or other culturally representative artwork, to a lunch or invitation to an event, and more lavish and expensive gifts and hospitality.\nNote \u2013 In this DAOD, a COI is an organizational COI, a personal COI or a conflict of duties, as applicable.\nPurpose\n3.2 The purpose of this DAOD is to ensure that the acceptance of such offers does not compromise or appear to compromise the integrity and impartiality of DND employees and CAF members, or that of the Government of Canada (GC), the DND or the CAF, and that non-acceptance does not disregard foreign customs or diplomatic protocol. This DAOD provides direction to DND employees and CAF members in respect of soliciting or accepting gifts, hospitality and other benefits from sources external to the DND and the CAF, including from foreign sources.\nCompliance\n3.3 In addition to the principles, rules and procedures set out in this DAOD, DND employees and CAF members are also required to comply with the Department of National Defence and Canadian Forces Code of Values and Ethics. DND employees are also required to comply with the Treasury Board (TB) Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector and the TB Policy on Conflict of Interest and Post-Employment. CAF members are also required to comply with QR&O article 19.39, Dealings with Contractors, QR&O article 19.40, Acceptance of Gifts from Foreign Sources, and QR&O article 103.49, Miscellaneous Offences.\n3.4 Compliance with this DAOD by DND employees and CAF members is also necessary to ensure that the acceptance of any gift, hospitality or other benefit is not contrary to paragraph 121(1)(c) of the Criminal Code.\nNotification of Non-Compliance\n3.5 The DDEP is responsible for notifying the CRS of any non-compliance with this DAOD.\n4. General Application\nOffers\n4.1 A DND employee or CAF member must not, in their public roles, accept any gift, hospitality or other benefit for themselves or their organization, except in accordance with the provisions set out in this DAOD. This includes:\nfree or discounted admission to sporting, cultural or recreational activities;\nevents arising out of an actual or potential business interaction related to their official duties; and\ngifts-in-kind or monetary exchanges for the benefit of their organization.\nAttendance at Events\n4.2 The issue of COI or potential for adverse public perception resulting from attending an event with a person, group or organization, having actual or prospective dealings with the DND and the CAF, may not be fully addressed by a DND employee or CAF member purchasing their own ticket or paying their own fees for the event.\n5. Accepting an Offer without Written Approval\nGeneral Discounts and Free Access\n5.1 A DND employee or CAF member may accept individually, without written approval, a discount or preferential rate normally offered to the public at large, the public sector as a whole, or DND employees or CAF members and their families at large. This includes, for example, discounts to amusement parks or free access to transportation by a Crown corporation, offered as support to the DND or the CAF.\nNecessary Conditions\n5.2 In all other cases, a DND employee or CAF member, who is offered, individually or in a small group, a gift, hospitality or other benefit, may only accept it, without the written approval of an approving authority, if the gift, hospitality or other benefit meets all the following conditions:\nit is of minimal value;\nit arises out of an activity or event related to the official duties of the DND employee or the CAF member;\nit is within the normal standards of courtesy, hospitality or protocol;\nit does not compromise or appear to compromise in any way the integrity of the DND employee or the CAF member concerned or the integrity of the DND or the CAF; and\nthe offer is infrequent in nature.\nNote \u2013 Repeated offers of gifts, hospitality or other benefits should not be routinely accepted from a single source even if the conditions for acceptance without written approval are otherwise met.\nExamples\n5.3 The following are examples of items of a minimal value that may be accepted by a DND employee or a CAF member without written approval:\na promotional item or incidental gift of minimal value, such as a mug, pen, T-shirt, ball cap or other general article;\nan occasional dinner or lunch at the expense of a contractor or foreign representative to discuss business or defence affairs, as long as the associated costs are reasonable;\nan invitation to a corporate or association reception at the expense of the event organizer, if the hospitality provided is modest, such as a happy hour, and a representational cross-section of the private sector and of the GC is invited;\nan invitation to a conference or professional development activity if there is a mutual benefit that respects the criteria in paragraph 5.2, particularly as to value, frequency and the business context; oran invitation to a government-sanctioned event, such as the Vimy Award, if there is a significant benefit to the GC, the DND or the CAF.\n6. Accepting an Offer with Written Approval\nConditions and Process for Written Approval\n6.1 A DND employee or CAF member must not accept a gift, hospitality or other benefit of more than minimal value without the prior written approval of an approving authority as listed in paragraph 6.7.\n6.2 An approving authority may only approve the acceptance of an item requiring written approval if satisfied that acceptance meets all the following conditions:\nit would not place the recipient in a COI that compromises or appears to compromise the integrity of the DND or the CAF, nor create potential for adverse public perception; and\nthere exists either:\na broader GC, DND or CAF interest, such as the promotion of public support or a strategic alliance in support of the DND or the CAF, the promotion of Canadian industry at an event hosted by an industry association or, in the case of an offer from a foreign source, the promotion of a strategic foreign alliance in support of the DND or the CAF; or\na broader societal interest, such as the donation of proceeds to a recognized charity.\nExamples\n6.3 The following are examples of items above a minimal value that may only be accepted by a DND employee or a CAF member with the prior written approval of an approving authority:\ntransportation and accommodation expenses to attend a conference or presentation, when such attendance will provide clear benefits to the DND or the CAF;\na culturally representative artwork which has or may have more than a minimal value;\nan invitation to a sporting, cultural or other recreational event if recognition of the DND or of the CAF is the primary factor in the invitation being extended; and\nany gifts-in-kind for a number of members of an organization if the total value is above a minimal value or may create adverse public perception.\nContractor or Association Receptions\n6.4 In the case of an invitation to a reception at the expense of a contractor or association, the total value of the hospitality to be provided is determinative of the need for written approval. When determining the total value, a DND employee or CAF member must consider not only the actual food or drinks provided, but also the venue and any form of entertainment offered, as well as the inclusion of family members or any other personal advantages related to the proposed hospitality. If the total value is determined to be above a minimal value, such hospitality may only be accepted if approved in accordance with paragraph 6.2 by an approving authority.\nRequest in Writing for Approval\n6.5 A DND employee or a CAF member who requires the approval of an approving authority to accept or retain a gift, hospitality or other benefit must submit a request in writing to their supervisor, manager or commanding officer (CO).\nProcess for Written Approval\n6.6 The process for obtaining written approval to accept or retain a gift, hospitality or other benefit is as follows:\nThe \u2026\nmust \u2026\nsupervisor, manager or CO who receives the request from a subordinate\nreview the request as soon as practicable and either:\nadvise the DND employee or CAF member in writing to decline or accept the gift, hospitality or other benefit based on the instructions in this DAOD;\nif unsure about the appropriate course of action to take concerning the declining or acceptance, consult the chain of command or the DDEP and advise the DND employee or CAF member in writing; or\nrefer the matter to the appropriate approving authority for a decision.\nCRS\ninform a DND employee, CAF member, supervisor, CO or approving authority as to the permissibility of accepting the gift, hospitality or other benefit; or\nrecommend that a matter be referred to an appropriate approving authority for a decision if acceptance with written approval is required under this DAOD.\nappropriate approving authority\ndirect in writing that any gift, hospitality or other benefit, which requires written approval under this DAOD, be declined or approved; or\nin the case of any improper gift, hospitality or other benefit that has been accepted, direct in writing as appropriate:\nits return;\nits retention; or\nits disposal in accordance with DAOD 3013-1, Disposal of Surplus Materiel.\nNote \u2013 If unsure about the appropriate course of action to take concerning the acceptance or disposition of the gift, hospitality or other benefit, an approving authority should consult the CRS.\nApproving Authorities\n6.7 The following are approving authorities responsible for the acceptance of a gift, hospitality or other benefit:\nThe \u2026\nfor \u2026\nDeputy Minister and the Chief of the Defence Staff\nlevel one (L1) advisors, and the level two (L2) advisors outside the National Capital Region (NCR).\nL1 advisor in the NCR\ntheir respective organizations within the NCR.\nL2 advisor outside the NCR\ntheir respective organizations outside the NCR.\nExceptional Circumstances\n6.8 A DND employee or CAF member who, in exceptional circumstances such as when employed in a civil-military relations or embassy role, is compelled to accept a gift, hospitality or other benefit without obtaining prior written approval, for example, in circumstances that might otherwise disregard diplomatic or foreign protocol, must accept the gift, hospitality or other benefit in the name of the DND or of the CAF, and then disclose the matter as soon as practicable, preferably in writing, to their supervisor or the CO. The supervisor or the CO must then, in accordance with the table in paragraph 6.6, direct the DND employee or the CAF member as to retention or disposition of the item, or refer the matter to the appropriate approving authority for final determination.\n7. Consequences\nConsequences of Non-Compliance\n7.1 Non-compliance with this DAOD may have consequences for both the DND and the CAF as institutions, and for DND employees and CAF members as individuals. Suspected non-compliance will be investigated. The nature and severity of the consequences resulting from actual non-compliance will be commensurate with the circumstances of the non-compliance.\nNote \u2013 In respect of the compliance of DND employees, see the TB Framework for the Management of Compliance for additional information.\nFailure by a DND Employee to Comply\n7.2 A DND employee who fails to comply with this DAOD, or the provisions of the Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector and the Department of National Defence and Canadian Forces Code of Values and Ethics in respect of the acceptance of gifts, hospitality or other benefits, may be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment under DAOD 5016-0, Standards of Civilian Conduct and Discipline.\nFailure by a CAF Member to Comply\n7.3 A CAF member who fails to comply with this DAOD or the provisions of the Department of National Defence and Canadian Forces Code of Values and Ethics in respect of the acceptance of gifts, hospitality or other benefits may be subject to one or more of the following:\nchange of duties;\nrelease or other administrative action as set out in the Administrative Review (AR) Decisions paragraph of DAOD 5019-2, Administrative Review; and\ndisciplinary action under the National Defence Act.\nRecourse\n7.4 Any DND employee or CAF member who disagrees with a decision on the appropriate arrangements necessary to achieve compliance with this DAOD, the Department of National Defence and Canadian Forces Code of Values and Ethics or, additionally in the case of a DND employee, the Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector and the Policy on Conflict of Interest and Post-Employment, may have recourse by submitting a grievance in accordance with established processes.\n8.

The Canadian Forces is pleased to present you the Over-the-counter Drugs Benefit program (OTC card program). Along with a valid Blue Cross card, you may now obtain selected non-prescription medications to treat minor, self-limiting ailments, after consultation with a civilian pharmacist.\n2. The access to OTCs directly from a civilian pharmacist is a privilege and not an entitlement. The access will be equivalent to the one available at a Base Pharmacy. If you believe you require a non-prescription medication for a minor medical ailment, contact a civilian pharmacist that accepts the Blue Cross card. The pharmacist will assess if, in fact, an over-the-counter drug is appropriate to treat your ailment, or if you need to be referred to a physician. Present to the pharmacist your OTC card along with your Blue Cross and identity cards.\n3. If an eligible over-the-counter drug benefit is recommended to treat your ailment, the pharmacist will document your name, service number, treated ailment, and recommended medication; your signature will also be required to authorize the transmission of the claim on the Blue Cross network.\n4. All the instructions for the pharmacist are on the OTC card. Once the transaction has been successfully transmitted to Blue Cross, you will not have any out-of-pocket expenses.\n5. You may utilize this service solely for your personal needs. The access to non-prescription benefits is for the acute treatment of minor ailments of the Member only, and not for family members.\n6. Use of the OTC card is intended solely for members whose unit is without usual military pharmacy services. Members who have access to a Base Pharmacy shall not use the OTC card.\n7. Use of the card is a privilege and not an entitlement. The CF could revoke this privilege and recover money it paid for medications from military members who make inappropriate use of the OTC card.\n8. Members who choose to make use of the OTC card, consent to the CF tabulating and analyzing OTC drug use data for statistical epidemiological purposes.\n9. Aircrew members who choose to make use of the OTC card are required to follow all regulations regarding use of medication (including non-prescription medications) use and flying.\n10.

This allows you to make payments over time until your debt is paid in full.\nA payment arrangement is an agreement between you and the CRA to pay your debt over a\u00a0 period of time. The CRA will work with you to determine the payment amount and the length of the payment arrangement.\nThe Income and expense worksheet\u00a0is an optional budget tool to help you determine what you can afford to pay on a regular basis. A conversation with a CRA representative is still required to make a payment arrangement.\nTo make a payment arrangement:\nContact the CRA to set up your payment arrangement\nGo to Payment methods to make your payment\nYou must pay as agreed, continue to file all returns on time, and stay up to date with your tax obligations. Payment arrangements are subject to periodic reviews.\nEven if you have a payment arrangement and are making payments, the CRA is authorized to take amounts from any credits you may otherwise receive in order to pay your debt.\nIf your situation changes and you cannot continue with your payment arrangement, you must contact the CRA. If you do not, the CRA may proceed with legal actions to collect the balance of your debt. Go to Consequences of not paying for more information.\nIf you are unable to make a payment or payment arrangement, go to Unable to pay.\nIf you cannot reach the CRA\nWait times could be longer than usual due to the high level of calls. Follow the instructions in Payment methods to send a payment. If you are not sending payment in full, a CRA representative may contact you afterwards to discuss further the repayment of your debt.\nPayment methods\nOnline\nThe easiest way to pay is through My Account for Individuals.\nYou can also use the online services of your Canadian financial institution:\nSearch for the Canada Revenue Agency as a payee\nSelect Canada Emergency Benefit Repayment or something similar as payee names may differ based on the financial institution\nEnter your\u00a0Social insurance number (SIN) as the account number\nPay now with My Payment\nPay with pre-authorized debit (PAD) services\nGo to the website My Account for Individuals\nVisit your financial institution to set up PAD arrangements using the remittance voucher you received in the mail\nBy Mail\nMake your cheque or money order payable to \u201cReceiver General for Canada.\u201d\nWrite your\u00a0Social insurance number (SIN) and \u201crepayment of CEB/CRB\u201d on the back of your cheque or money order\nMail your payment to:\nRevenue Processing \u2013 Repayment of emergency and recovery benefits\nSudbury Tax Centre\n1050 Notre Dame Avenue\nSudbury ON P3A 0C3\nDo not send cash by mail.\nIn person\nAt your financial institution with your remittance voucher\nUnable to pay\nIf you cannot pay in full, or make monthly payments on your outstanding balance, contact the CRA.\nIf you do not call or make a payment arrangement, the CRA may take legal action to collect your debt. Go to Consequences of not paying for more information.\nInsolvency or bankruptcy\n\nIf you are insolvent or under bankruptcy, contact your trustee about your\u00a0overpayments of individual COVID-19 benefits or visit\u00a0the Office of the superintendent of bankruptcy for more information.\nConsequences of not paying\nIf you do not pay your debt or refuse to cooperate, the CRA may take legal action which could result in serious financial or legal consequences for you.\nBefore starting legal action, the CRA must do the following:\nmake 3 attempts to give verbal legal warning by phone\nsend 1 written legal warning letter\nFor more information, go to Legal warning about collection of debt.\nOnce the CRA has started any of the following legal actions, the CRA will not usually withdraw them.\nTo avoid legal action, go to Debt payment or Unable to pay.\nGarnishing wages or other sources\nRequirement to pay (redirect money owed to you by a third party)\nThe\u00a0CRA\u00a0can issue a Requirement to pay (RTP) to take funds that a third party owes you or holds for you. A third party could include a person or organization such as your employer or your bank.\nThe\u00a0RTP\u00a0is typically sent at 30% of your take home pay and 100% of funds held in your financial institution. The\u00a0CRA\u00a0will apply the funds to your debt.\nSet-off (redirecting money owed to you by the federal government)\nThe CRA can use your federal income, goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax (GST/HST) credits or any future income tax refunds to reduce your debt.\nSet-offs can be done even if you have a payment arrangement and are making payments.\nAsset liens and seizures\nThe CRA can get a provincial judgement or a certificate from the Federal Court confirming the amount you owe. This will make your debt a matter of public record and allow the CRA to proceed with asset liens and seizures.\u00a0The\u00a0CRA\u00a0will usually notify you by mail that your debt has been certified in Federal Court. The letter advises you that if you do not resolve your account, the\u00a0CRA\u00a0may take further legal action to pay the debt.\nRegistering a lien on assets\nOnce the debt is certified, the CRA can register a lien against your assets and property, including your personal residence.
