This means that you can receive a maximum amount of $650 per week.\nYou can get benefits for up to a maximum of 45 weeks\nYou can receive EI from 14 weeks up to a maximum of 45 weeks, depending on the unemployment rate in your region at the time of filing your claim and the amount of insurable hours you've accumulated in the last 52 weeks or since your last claim, whichever is shorter.\nSeasonal workers\nIf you\u2019re a seasonal worker, you may be eligible for 5 additional weeks of benefits, up to a maximum of 45 weeks.\nNumber of weeks of EI regular benefits payable\nNumber of hours of insurable employment\n6% and less\n6.1%\nto\n7.0%\n7.1%\nto\n8.0%\n8.1%\nto\n9.0%\n9.1%\nto\n10.0%\n10.1%\nto\n11.0%\n11.1%\nto\n12.0%\n12.1%\nto\n13.0%\n13.1%\nto\n14.0%\n14.1%\nto\n15.0%\n15.1%\nto\n16.0%\n16% and more\n420 to 454\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n26\n28\n30\n32\n455 to 489\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n24\n26\n28\n30\n32\n490 to 524\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n23\n25\n27\n29\n31\n33\n525 to 559\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n21\n23\n25\n27\n29\n31\n33\n560 to 594\n0\n0\n0\n0\n20\n22\n24\n26\n28\n30\n32\n34\n595 to 629\n0\n0\n0\n18\n20\n22\n24\n26\n28\n30\n32\n34\n630 to 664\n0\n0\n17\n19\n21\n23\n25\n27\n29\n31\n33\n35\n665 to 699\n0\n15\n17\n19\n21\n23\n25\n27\n29\n31\n33\n35\n700 to 734\n14\n16\n18\n20\n22\n24\n26\n28\n30\n32\n34\n36\n735 to 769\n14\n16\n18\n20\n22\n24\n26\n28\n30\n32\n34\n36\n770 to 804\n15\n17\n19\n21\n23\n25\n27\n29\n31\n33\n35\n37\n805 to 839\n15\n17\n19\n21\n23\n25\n27\n29\n31\n33\n35\n37\n840 to 874\n16\n18\n20\n22\n24\n26\n28\n30\n32\n34\n36\n38\n875 to 909\n16\n18\n20\n22\n24\n26\n28\n30\n32\n34\n36\n38\n910 to 944\n17\n19\n21\n23\n25\n27\n29\n31\n33\n35\n37\n39\n945 to 979\n17\n19\n21\n23\n25\n27\n29\n31\n33\n35\n37\n39\n980 to 1,014\n18\n20\n22\n24\n26\n28\n30\n32\n34\n36\n38\n40\n1,015 to 1,049\n18\n20\n22\n24\n26\n28\n30\n32\n34\n36\n38\n40\n1,050 to 1,084\n19\n21\n23\n25\n27\n29\n31\n33\n35\n37\n39\n41\n1,085 to 1,119\n19\n21\n23\n25\n27\n29\n31\n33\n35\n37\n39\n41\n1,120 to 1,154\n20\n22\n24\n26\n28\n30\n32\n34\n36\n38\n40\n42\n1,155 to 1,189\n20\n22\n24\n26\n28\n30\n32\n34\n36\n38\n40\n42\n1,190 to 1,224\n21\n23\n25\n27\n29\n31\n33\n35\n37\n39\n41\n43\n1,225 to 1,259\n21\n23\n25\n27\n29\n31\n33\n35\n37\n39\n41\n43\n1,260 to 1,294\n22\n24\n26\n28\n30\n32\n34\n36\n38\n40\n42\n44\n1,295 to 1,329\n22\n24\n26\n28\n30\n32\n34\n36\n38\n40\n42\n44\n1,330 to 1,364\n23\n25\n27\n29\n31\n33\n35\n37\n39\n41\n43\n45\n1,365 to 1,399\n23\n25\n27\n29\n31\n33\n35\n37\n39\n41\n43\n45\n1,400 to 1,434\n24\n26\n28\n30\n32\n34\n36\n38\n40\n42\n44\n45\n1,435 to 1,469\n25\n27\n29\n31\n33\n35\n37\n39\n41\n43\n45\n45\n1,470 to 1,504\n26\n28\n30\n32\n34\n36\n38\n40\n42\n44\n45\n45\n1,505 to 1,539\n27\n29\n31\n33\n35\n37\n39\n41\n43\n45\n45\n45\n1,540 to 1,574\n28\n30\n32\n34\n36\n38\n40\n42\n44\n45\n45\n45\n1,575 to 1,609\n29\n31\n33\n35\n37\n39\n41\n43\n45\n45\n45\n45\n1,610 to 1,644\n30\n32\n34\n36\n38\n40\n42\n44\n45\n45\n45\n45\n1,645 to 1,679\n31\n33\n35\n37\n39\n41\n43\n45\n45\n45\n45\n45\n1,680 to 1,714\n32\n34\n36\n38\n40\n42\n44\n45\n45\n45\n45\n45\n1,715 to 1,749\n33\n35\n37\n39\n41\n43\n45\n45\n45\n45\n45\n45\n1,750 to 1,784\n34\n36\n38\n40\n42\n44\n45\n45\n45\n45\n45\n45\n1,785 to 1,819\n35\n37\n39\n41\n43\n45\n45\n45\n45\n45\n45\n45\n1,820 and more\n36\n38\n40\n42\n44\n45\n45\n45\n45\n45\n45\n45\nThe number of weeks for which you may receive benefits doesn\u2019t change if you move to another region after your benefit period begins.\nHow we calculate your weekly benefit amount\nThe amount of weekly benefits is calculated as follows:\nwe calculate your total insurable earnings for the required number of best weeks (the weeks that you earned the most money, including insurable tips and commissions) based on the information you provide and/or your record(s) of employment\nwe determine the divisor (number of best weeks) that corresponds to your regional rate of unemployment\nwe divide your total insurable earnings for your best weeks by your required number of best weeks\nwe then multiply the result by 55% to obtain the amount of your weekly benefits\nIn regions of Canada with the highest rates of unemployment, we\u2019ll calculate using the best 14 weeks. In regions of Canada with the lowest rates of unemployment, we\u2019ll use the best 22 weeks. In other regions, the number of weeks used to calculate benefits will be somewhere between 14 and 22, depending on the unemployment rate in those regions.\nRequired number of best weeks by regional rate of unemployment\nRegional rate of unemployment\nRequired weeks\n6% or less\n22\n6.1% to 7%\n21\n7.1% to 8%\n20\n8.1% to 9%\n19\n9.1% to 10%\n18\n10.1% to 11%\n17\n11.1% to 12%\n16\n12.1% to 13%\n15\n13.1% or more\n14\nTo find out the rate of unemployment in your region, visit EI Program Characteristics.\nOnce the weekly benefit rate is established, it will remain unchanged over the life of your claim.\nIf your net family income is $25,921 or less\nIf your net family income doesn\u2019t exceed $25,921 per year, you have children and you or your spouse receives the Canada Child Benefit, you\u2019re considered a member of a low-income family. Therefore, you may be eligible to receive the EI family supplement.\nThe family supplement rate is based on:\nyour net family income up to a maximum of $25,921 per year\nthe number of children in the family and their ages\nThe family supplement may increase your benefit rate up to 80% of your average insurable earnings. If you and your spouse claim EI benefits at the same time, only 1 of you can receive the family supplement. It is generally better for the spouse with the lower benefit rate to receive the supplement.\nAs your income level rises, the Family Supplement gradually decreases, so that when the maximum income of $25,921 is reached no supplement is payable.\nTaxes are deducted from EI payments\nEI benefits are taxable, no matter what type of benefits you receive. Federal and provincial or territorial taxes, where applicable, will therefore be deducted from your payment.\nRelated links\nSubmitting EI reports\nChecklist: Employment Insurance regular benefits application\nMy Service Canada Account\nVariable best weeks\nEI earning charts\nEI and the various types of earnings\nEI economic regions\nContact us\nEI contact EI information - Individuals\nDocument navigation\nPrevious - Do you qualify\nNext - Apply\nPage feedback\nDid you find what you were looking for?\nYes Yes No\nIf not, tell us why below:\nWhat was wrong?\nI can't find the information\nThe information is hard to understand\nThere was an error or something didn't work\nOther reason\nPlease provide more details (maximum 300 characters)\nYou will not receive a reply.

For the benefit to be paid, the deceased contributor must have made sufficient contributions to the CPP\nA maximum of 2 children's benefits can be paid to a child.\nStep 2 Do you qualify\nTo be eligible, the child must be either:\nunder age 18, or\nunder age 25 and in full-time attendance at a recognized school or university\nThe child must also be:\nthe natural child of the contributor\na child adopted \"legally\" or \"in fact\" by the contributor while under the age of 21\na child \"legally\" or \"in fact\" in the custody and control of the contributor while under the age of 21\nA child may be eligible if the parent or guardian:\nis receiving a CPP disability benefit (either the disability benefit or the post-retirement disability benefit)\nhas died and met the CPP contributory requirements for a CPP death benefit\nIf the child is age 18 to 25, the child must be attending school full-time at a recognized educational institution in order to receive a children's benefit.\nOnce a child turns 25, they are no longer eligible for these benefits.\nStep 3 How much could a child receive\nThe monthly children's benefit is a flat rate that is adjusted annually. For the current year the rate is $281.72 (2023). Consult the table of current Canada Pension Plan (CPP) payment amounts.\nStep 4 When to apply\nDependent children, or their parent or guardian, should complete an application when any of the following happens:\na parent or guardian has applied for a disability benefit (you do not have to wait for the benefit to be approved before applying)\nwhen a child comes into the custody and control of a parent or guardian who receives a disability benefit\na parent or guardian dies\nYou should apply as soon as possible. If you delay, you might lose benefits. The Canada Pension Plan can only make back payments for up to 12 months.\nStep 5 Who should complete the application\nIf you have custody and control of a dependent child of a disabled or deceased contributor and the child is under the age of 18, you should apply for the children's benefit on behalf of the child. However, children under age 18, who are living on their own and capable of managing their own affairs may complete their own application.\nStep 6 Apply\nApply for a child under age 18\nChild of a disabled contributor:\ncomplete the Application for Benefits for Under Age 18 Children of a Canada Pension Plan Disabled Contributor (ISP1152), or\ncomplete section F of the Application for Canada Pension Plan Disability Benefits (ISP1151)\ninclude certified true copies of the required documentation, and\nmail the form to us or drop it off at a Service Canada office\nChild of a deceased contributor:\ncomplete the Application for a Canada Pension Plan Survivor's Pension and Child(ren)'s Benefits (ISP1300)\ninclude certified true copies of the required documentation, and\nmail the form to us or drop it off at a Service Canada office\nApply for a child aged 18 to 25 in full-time attendance at a recognized school or university\nStudents aged 18 to 25 who are applying for or renewing their children's benefit are required to have the Declaration of Attendance at School or University signed by the registrar at the educational institution they are attending. If the student is no longer in school or not attending classes full time, they are required to notify us.\nDeclaration of attendance at school or university\nYou should have received a Declaration of Attendance at School or University. You are required to complete this document and provide proof of enrolment.\nWe will accept the following as proof of enrolment:\nthe completed Section C of the Declaration of Attendance at School or University signed by the school, or\nan official proof of enrolment document from your on-line student account, or\nan electronic attestation from a school official, such as an email, confirming that you are in full time attendance\nThe attestation must be a written statement or declaration that includes:\nyour name\nyour student ID\nyour program of study\ninformation about your school (name and address)\nstart and end dates for the semester, term or school year, and\nenrolment status for the semester, term or school year (full-time or part-time)\nIf you are applying for the first time, there are 2 ways to apply.\nApply online\nLog into your My Service Canada Account (MSCA) and complete the online Canada Pension Plan Child's Benefit form\nComplete the Declaration of Attendance at School or University (ISP1401)\nInclude certified true copies of the required documentation, and\nMail the Declaration of Attendance at School or University (ISP 1401) form and certified true copies to us or drop them off at a Service Canada office\nApply using a paper application\nComplete the Application for a Canada Pension Plan Child's Benefit (ISP1400)\nComplete the Declaration of Attendance at School or University (ISP1401)\nInclude certified true copies of the required documentation, and\nMail the forms to us or drop them off at a Service Canada office\nIf you are a dependent child aged 18 to 25, and in full-time attendance at a school or university, you should apply for the children's benefit yourself.\nRenew benefits for a child aged 18 to 25 in full-time attendance at a recognized school or university\nIf you are a full-time student aged 18 to 25, and you are renewing your benefits, there are 2 ways to renew.\nRenew your benefits online\nLog into your My Service Canada Account (MSCA) and complete the online Declaration of Attendance at School or University, and\nUpload your proof of enrolment\nRenew your benefits using a paper application\nIf you cannot renew your benefit online, you can always declare your attendance using the paper application:\ncomplete the Declaration of Attendance at School or University (ISP1401)\ninclude your proof of enrolment, and\nmail the form to us or drop it off at a Service Canada office\nSchool attendance for child aged 18 to 25\nIf you are age 18 to 25, you must be attending school full-time at a recognized educational institution in order to receive a children's benefit.\nRecognized school or university\nWe define recognized educational institutions as:\nschools\ncolleges\nuniversities\nother educational institutions\nThat provide training or instruction of an:\neducational\nprofessional\nvocational\ntechnical nature\nThe institution must also be recognized by the province in which it is located.\nAttending school outside Canada\nThe school must be recognized by the CPP, and you must continue to meet all eligibility requirements.\nAttending school part-time or at multiple institutions\nIn certain situations, you may be eligible for a benefit when you attend school part-time. For example, if you are taking courses at more than one educational institution, the course hours may add up to full-time attendance. Each situation is considered. Contact Service Canada for details.\nTaking evening classes\nThe amount and duration of classes determine full-time school attendance, not whether the classes are taken during the day or evening. Evening classes and daytime classes have the same value when determining full-time attendance.\nTaking virtual or off-site classes\nIt is possible to be considered a full-time student without being physically present at the institution. Documentation requirements are different for students taking correspondence classes. To obtain information on documentation necessary to satisfy the requirements to be eligible for a child's benefit, please contact Service Canada.\nCompleting prerequisites to complete a program\nStudents who have obtained a diploma or degree may have to take additional classes. Students may also need to take a class or multiple classes to complete the requirements of a certificate, diploma or degree. Those students can be considered in full-time attendance if it is proven that the class is a prerequisite or a requirement to complete their program.\nVacation\nThe children's benefit is paid during normal school vacations, but will stop if the child has not sent us a signed school attendance form when the child returns to school following vacation.\nYou must complete the declaration form when you first apply for the benefit, at the beginning of every school year, and when you return to school after having left for a time.\nWe may also ask you to renew your benefits at the beginning of each semester if you are:\non a semester system\nif your attendance starts in the middle of the traditional school year\nThe Declaration of Attendance at School or University (ISP1401) must be completed each year or semester and signed by both the child and a school official.\nIf the child leaves school and then later returns to school full time, the child must complete a new Declaration of Attendance at School or University (ISP1401) to reinstate the children's benefit. It will be paid starting the month the child returns to school. The children's benefit will not be reinstated unless the child submits a new form.\nStep 7 After you apply\nYour first payment\nChildren of disabled CPP contributors:\nthe month the contributor's disability benefit starts\nthe month after the child is born or becomes the contributor's child, or\n12 months before the application was received, including the month it was received\nChildren of deceased CPP contributors:\nthe month after the contributor's death\nthe month after the child is born or becomes the contributor's child, or\n12 months before the application was received, including the month it was received\nWho receives the payment\nChildren of disabled CPP contributors:\nThe benefit is paid on behalf of the child to the disabled contributor, if they have any custody and control of the child. If the disabled contributor has no custody and control of the child, the person or agency having custody and control may receive the disabled contributor's child benefit on behalf of the child.\nChildren of deceased CPP contributors:\nThe benefit is paid on behalf of the child to the person or agency who has custody and control of the child. However, in some cases, a children's benefit can be paid directly to children under age 18 who have applied and are capable of managing their own affairs.\nChildren aged 18 to 25 in full-time attendance at a recognized school or university:\nThe benefit is paid directly to the child.\nWhen the benefit could stop\nThe benefit will stop:\nthe month after the child turns 18, or, if over 18, is no longer in full-time attendance at a school or university\nthe month after the child turns 25\nthe month after the parent or guardian's disability benefit stops\nthe month after a child is no longer in the custody and control of the parent or guardian receiving a disability benefit\nthe month after the child dies\nIf your situation changes\nYou must notify Service Canada if:\nyou stop attending school (for children 18 to 25 years old)\nyour attendance changes from full-time to part-time (for children 18 to 25 years old)\nyour relationship to the child or to the contributor ends or changes\na child is being added to the family or is no longer in your custody and control\nyou change your name, address or bank account for direct deposit\nRemember, if you receive payments you are not entitled to, you will have to pay them back.\nWhen a child reaches 18\nChildren are eligible for benefits from age 18 until age 25, as long as they remain in full-time attendance at a school or university.\nPlease refer to the section on how to apply for a child aged 18 to 25 in full-time attendance at a recognized school or university.\nWhen a child works in the summer\nEligibility for the children's benefit is not affected by working in the summer.\nWhen a child gets married\nBenefits are not affected if the child marries, as long as all eligibility requirements continue to be met.\nConverting a disabled contributor's child's benefit into a surviving child's benefit\nYour eligibility for the disabled contributor's children's benefit would end the month of your parent's death. However, you could then be eligible for the children's benefit as the child of a deceased CPP contributor.\nIf you are aged 18 to 25 and receiving the benefit, we convert it to a surviving child's benefit automatically when we are notified of the contributor's death. However, an application for the surviving child's benefit must be made for children under the age of 18.\nAbsences from school\nYou must notify Service Canada should you interrupt, terminate or reduce your attendance at school or university. Please notify Service Canada when you have any absences to determine what may be required to continue receiving your benefits.\nNote: Make sure to document the duration and reasons for absences during your current or past academic year on the Declaration of Attendance at School or University (ISP1401).\nFor extended absence periods, you will require an illness certificate (ISP-1403).\nCircumstances where absences would require an illness certificate\nAbsences that occur during the school year\nIllness certificates can cover temporary breaks in attendance, starting after the beginning of the school year and ending before its scheduled completion.

If you're not eligible, we'll notify you of the decision made about your application.\nWaiting period\nBefore you start receiving benefits, there is 1 week for which you won't be paid. This is called the waiting period. It's like the deductible that you pay for other types of insurance.\nWhen payments stop\nYou stop receiving benefits if:\nyou receive all the weeks of benefits to which you were entitled\nthe payment timeframe during which you can receive benefits ends\nyou stop filing your bi-weekly report\nyou request a termination of your claim to file a new claim\nIf you start working before you finish your current EI claim, you must tell us when you complete your EI report so we can adjust or stop your claim, depending on whether the work is full-time, part-time or by contract.

If you earn any money above this 90%, we'll deduct it dollar for dollar from your benefits.\nFor more information, visit the Working While on Claim page.\nWhen you work and receive benefits at the same time, you must report your work earnings and hours for each week you work, in the week in which the work occurred.\nIf you receive other payments while receiving EI, some types of earnings will be deducted from your EI benefits, while other types of income have no impact on your EI benefits. You can refer to the earnings chart to find out if a payment constitutes earnings for benefit purposes and, if so, how those earnings are allocated.\nIf you travel outside of Canada\nYou\u2019re not usually eligible to receive regular benefits while you\u2019re away from Canada. However, you may receive regular benefits if you show that you\u2019re available for work in Canada while abroad. You must also notify us of your travel on My Service Canada Account (MSCA) or through your bi-weekly report.\nYou can be outside Canada for a period of 7 consecutive days for the purpose of:\nattending the funeral of a member of your immediate family or a close relative\naccompanying a member of your immediate family to a medical facility, provided that the treatment sought is not readily available in the family member's area of residence in Canada\nvisiting a member of your immediate family who is seriously ill or injured\nattending a bona fide job interview\nYou can be away from Canada for a period of 14 consecutive days for the purpose of conducting a bona fide job search.\nIf you indicate that you\u2019ve taken measures to be reached if an employment opportunity presents itself during your absence and that you\u2019re able to return to Canada within 48 hours, we\u2019ll accept that you\u2019ve proven your availability.\nOne measure we take to enforce this rule is to compare EI information with information from the Canada Border Services Agency. If we find you\u2019ve been out of the country while collecting benefits, we\u2019ll determine whether you were entitled to receive those benefits. If you weren\u2019t entitled to receive them, we\u2019ll calculate how much we overpaid you, and you\u2019ll then have to repay the benefits.\nWe may also impose penalties of up to 3 times your weekly benefit rate or 3 times the amount of your overpayment. As well, you may have to work more hours or, in the case of fishing benefits, you may need more insurable earnings to qualify for benefits in the future.\nYou can receive different types of benefits one after the other\nYou can normally receive up to 50 weeks of benefits when regular benefits are combined with maternity, parental, sickness or caregiving benefits in the same benefit period (of 52 weeks).\nThe only exception is when EI regular benefits and extended parental benefits are paid during the 52-week period. As extended parental benefits are paid at a benefit rate of 33% of your average weekly insurable earnings, once 50 weeks of benefits have been paid, the weeks of extended parental benefits will be converted to an equivalent number of weeks that would have been paid at the 55% benefit rate. This conversion will determine how many more weeks of regular benefits and special benefits can be paid to reach the equivalent of 50 weeks paid at the 55% benefits rate. Any weeks where you return to work during this period will be considered weeks paid for the purposes of calculating the equivalent of 50 weeks paid at the 55% benefit rate. Once the number of additional weeks that can be paid is determined, the 52-week benefit period will be extended to allow for the additional weeks to be paid.\nIt's important to note that you can\u2019t receive more than 1 type of benefit at the same time.\nIf you\u2019re not well, someone else can manage your benefits for you\nIf you\u2019re unable to manage your own affairs due to health problems, a person other than an Employment and Social Development Canada employee may be appointed to act on your behalf. In that case, the form Appointment of Representative must be completed and returned with your EI application.\nIf you\u2019re eligible for EI, we\u2019ll authorize the payment of benefits to the representative acting on your behalf.\nRequesting EI benefits on behalf of a deceased person\nWhen a person dies, EI benefits payable to that person up to and including the day of the death may be paid to the legal representative Footnote 1 , or to a person authorized to inherit property of the deceased person.\nIf the deceased person had not applied for EI benefits, the legal representative must do the following, in the name of the deceased person, before benefits can be paid:\napply for benefits in the name of the deceased person\ncomplete the form Request for Payment of Benefit on Behalf of a Deceased Person\nprovide a death certificate issued by the province or territory, a certificate from the director of a funeral home or an administrator of a hospital or clinic, or a letter from a physician, graduate nurse, or member of the clergy\nIf the deceased person was receiving EI benefits before death, the legal representative must complete the form Request for Payment of Benefit on Behalf of a Deceased Person to cancel these benefits.\nIf EI benefits are paid after the death of someone in your family, the legal representative must repay the overpayment by making a cheque or money order to the Receiver General for Canada and sending it to the nearest overpayment recovery office.\nIt is important to notify the federal government of a death as quickly as possible to avoid overpayment of other benefit types.\nWork-Sharing\nThe EI Work-Sharing Program assists employers and employees facing lay-offs due to a decline in production. With the Work-Sharing agreement, available work is redistributed through a voluntary reduction in hours worked by all employees within 1 or more work units. This enables the employer to retain a full work force on a reduced work week, rather than laying off part of his or her work force. Employees are able to remain on the job and maintain skills and working habits and avoid uncertainties and hardship associated with total unemployment.\nSituations where you may owe money\nDeductions can never be taken for money owed directly to a person or company. However, deductions can be taken from your EI benefits to repay money you owe, if:\nyou received an overpayment from EI\nyou received an advance or assistance from the Government of Canada or any of its agencies, a provincial or municipal government, or any other authority and an arrangement has been taken with EI for the deduction. Your consent must be given in writing to the deduction and payment by EI. Example: you received an advance from a Social Services agency while waiting for your EI benefits to start\nthe Department of Justice issued a court order, according to the Family Orders and Agreements (FOA) Enforcement Assistance Act. Your EI benefits are garnished and forwarded to the Department of Justice that ensures payment to your spouse / dependents, according to the existing court order\nthe Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) may collect taxes owing according to the Income Tax Act, the Excise Tax Act or other provisions enforced by the CRA. Any taxes owing to federal or provincial governments may be garnished from your EI benefits\nA mistake on your EI report can affect your claim\nWe work to protect the EI program from misuse. One of the ways we do this is by working with employers and claimants to ensure the accuracy of the information we receive. With your help, we can reduce the amount of misuse and ensure that the EI program is used as it should be \u2014 as a program that provides temporary financial assistance to individuals who qualify.\nA mistake is an unintentional act. We know claimants can make mistakes when filing their reports.\nCommon mistakes include:\nestimating weekly earnings instead of putting in the actual amount earned\ndeclaring net earnings instead of gross earnings\nforgetting to declare all the earnings received\nwriting or entering the wrong number when reporting earnings, or\nadding the number of hours or amount of earnings incorrectly\nSome mistakes can delay benefit payments, while others can affect the amount of benefits you receive \u2014 meaning you were paid more or less than you were entitled to receive.\nEstimating your earnings can have the following effects:\nif you estimated your earnings for 1 week and your estimate was higher than the earnings you actually received, your benefit amount will be less than it should have been. If this happens, let us know and we\u2019ll adjust your file to make sure you receive all the benefits to which you\u2019re entitled\nif you estimated your earnings for 1 week and your estimate was lower than the earnings you actually received, your benefit amount will be higher than it should have been. Let us know if this happens. You\u2019ll have to repay the excess amount, but we\u2019ll ensure that repaying it causes no undue hardship. As well, we\u2019ll adjust your file to reflect your accurate information\nIf you notice a mistake on a completed form or report, or if there is a change in your circumstances that could affect your EI claim, tell Service Canada immediately. This will help prevent any future problems with your claim.\nYou may be penalized if you make a false statement related to your claim\nA misrepresentation occurs when someone knowingly completes a statement without declaring essential information, , makes false or misleading representations or statements, or misrepresents facts to make a false claim for benefits. You could face severe monetary penalties or prosecution in these cases. However, if you disclose your actions to Service Canada before an investigation begins, we may waive any monetary penalties and prosecutions that might otherwise apply.\nHere is an example of a situation where penalties may be imposed:\nAn EI benefit claimant goes on an ocean cruise for a month and arranges for a friend to conceal their absence by signing and returning 2 EI reports. As a result, the claimant illegally received $350 in benefits for each of the 4 weeks of the cruise. After investigation, we find that this was the first time the claimant and the friend had misused the EI system. As well, we find that they both knew that what they did was illegal but they did it anyway.\nIn this case, the claimant will have to repay $1,400 (4 weeks of benefits at $350 per week) and may have to pay a penalty of $700 ($350 for each of the 2 false reports filed during the holiday). The friend may also have to pay a penalty of $700 for the illegal act of filing 2 false reports on behalf of the claimant.\nThere are many situations when a penalty may apply, and the amount could become very high. Depending on the circumstances, the maximum penalty could be up to 3 times the amount of the overpayment, 3 times the weekly benefit rate for each incident of misrepresentation, or 3 times the maximum benefit rate. This could also affect your future benefits.\nIf you receive more than you're entitled to, you\u2019ll have a debt to repay\nWhen EI claimants receive benefits to which they are not entitled, the amount of the overpayment counts as a debt that must be repaid.\nWe charge interest on this debt when it results from claimants who knowingly withhold information or make false or misleading representations or statements. However, we do not charge interest on debt that results when we make an error in the benefit payment.\nThe rate of interest is the Bank of Canada average rate plus 3%. Interest is calculated daily and compounded monthly.\nMisusing the EI program may affect your future claims\nClaimants who misused the EI program and were assessed a violation may need more insurable earnings or hours to qualify for benefits in the future. The required amount rises based on the number and seriousness of misrepresentations that have been recorded in the 5-year period before the start of their claims.\nYour rights and responsibilities while receiving EI benefits\nThe EI program guarantees certain rights. There are also some basic responsibilities, for both you and Service Canada.\nYou have the right to:\nfile a claim for EI benefits\nreceive any benefits that are owing to you\nrequest a reconsideration of any decisions we make about your benefits that you find unsatisfactory\nsee any government record that contains your personal information, and\nbe served in the official language of your choice\nYour responsibilities include:\nbe capable of and available for work and unable to obtain suitable employment\nactively search for and accept offers of suitable employment.

You will get it automatically.\nNote:\nA child is eligible for the DTC when a medical practitioner certifies, on Form T2201, Disability Tax Credit Certificate, that the child has a severe and prolonged impairment in physical or mental functions, and the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) approves the form. You can send the form to the CRA at any time during the year.\nFor general questions related to the CDB, call 1-800-387-1193 or for information related to the DTC, call 1-800-959-8281.\nHow much you can expect to receive\nYour CDB payments are calculated using the following information:\nnumber of eligible children\nadjusted family net income (AFNI)\nmarital status\nEvery July, your CDB payments are recalculated based on your AFNI from the previous year.\nFor example, July 2022 to June 2023 payments are based on your income from your 2021 tax return; and July 2021 to June 2022 payments are based on your income from your 2020 tax return.\nFor the period of July 2022 to June 2023, you could get up to $2,985 ($248.75 per month) for each child who is eligible for the DTC.\nThe benefit starts being reduced when the adjusted family net income is greater than $71,060. The reduction is calculated as follows:\nFor families with one child eligible for the benefit, the reduction is 3.2% of the amount of adjusted family net income greater than $71,060.\nFor families with two or more children eligible for the benefit, the reduction is 5.7% of the amount of adjusted family net income greater than $71,060.\nYou can use the child and family benefits calculator to estimate how much you will get.\nNote:\nIf this is the first time you\u2019re getting the CDB, the CRA will automatically calculate your payments for the current and two previous benefit years. The benefit year runs from July of one year to June of the following year. For years before that, send a written request to your tax centre.\nTo continue getting benefits\nYou must remain eligible for the CCB and your child must also remain eligible for the DTC.\nTo avoid delays or interruption in your benefit payments, you need to do your taxes on time every year, even if you had no income at all or your income is tax exempt. If you have a spouse or common-law partner, they also need to do their taxes on time every year. The CRA uses the information from your income tax and benefit return to calculate your benefit and credit payments.\nTo make sure you are getting the right amount of benefits and credits, you must also keep your personal information updated with the CRA.\nLeaving an abusive or violent situation?

The earliest start date of the qualifying period is the week of March 1 for summer fishing or September 1 for winter fishing.\nThis is how we calculate your weekly benefit:\nwe calculate your total self-employment earnings from fishing during your qualifying period\u2014the last 31 weeks or from the start date of your last claim for EI benefits (we use the total earnings from the shorter period)\nwe determine the unemployment rate in your region and select the divisor that applies at that unemployment rate (see Table 1)\nwe divide your total self-employment earnings from fishing during your qualifying period by the applicable divisor. This gives us your weekly insurable earnings from self-employment in fishing\nif you have earnings from employment other than as a self-employed fisher, we calculate your total earnings from the last 26 weeks of that other employment, using only the weeks contained in the fishing qualifying period. We divide this amount by the applicable divisor or by the number of weeks worked, whichever is greater. This gives us your weekly insurable earnings from regular employment\nwe add the results from Steps 3 and 4 together to find your total weekly insurable earnings\nwe compare your total weekly insurable earnings with the allowed maximum weekly amount, and we select the lower figure. The maximum weekly amount can vary from year to year and is based on the maximum insurable earnings for the calendar year\nwe multiply that lower figure by 55% to obtain the amount of your weekly benefit\nTable 1 \u2013 Divisors used to calculate benefits\nRegional rate of unemployment\nMinimum divisor\n6% or less\n22\n6.1% to 7%\n21\n7.1% to 8%\n20\n8.1% to 9%\n19\n9.1% to 10%\n18\n10.1% to 11%\n17\n11.1% to 12%\n16\n12.1% to 13%\n15\n13.1% or more\n14\nExample 1\nIn 2023, John earns $9,865 from self-employment in fishing during his qualifying period of 31 weeks. The unemployment rate in his area is 11.5%, which means the divisor is 16. Dividing his fishing earnings of $9,865 by 16 gives him weekly insurable earnings of $616.56. This amount is lower than the maximum weekly amount, which is $1,182.69 in 2023. His weekly benefit rate is therefore $339 [($9,865 \u00f7 16) x 55%].\nExample 2\nIn 2023, John earns $9,865 from self-employment in fishing during his qualifying period of 31 weeks. The unemployment rate in his area is 11.5%, which means the divisor is 16. Dividing his fishing earnings of $9,865 by 16 gives him weekly insurable earnings of $616.56.\nHowever, within the last 26 weeks (which occurred in the 31-week qualifying period), John also works in another job during which he earns $10,000 in 15 weeks. Because these earnings aren't from self-employment in fishing, they're called regular\u00a0earnings. The unemployment rate in his area is 11.5%, which means the divisor is 16. Dividing his regular earnings of $10,000 by 16 gives him weekly insurable earnings of $625.00. We use the divisor of 16 for the regular earnings because it is greater than 15, which is the number of regular weeks of insurable earnings in the last 26 weeks.\nWe calculate John's total weekly insurable earnings as follows:\nfishing weekly earnings: $616.56\nregular weekly earnings: $625.00\ntotal weekly earnings: $1,241.56\nWhen the regular earnings are added to the fishing earnings, the total is greater than the maximum weekly amount of $1,182.69 per week. Since John's insurable earnings can't exceed the maximum weekly amount for 2023, we use that amount to calculate his benefit rate. John's weekly benefit rate is therefore $650 [($61,500 \u00f7 52 weeks) x 55%].\nNote\nThe maximum weekly amount is based on the yearly maximum insurable earnings amount. In 2023, the yearly maximum insurable earnings amount is $61,500. The maximum weekly amount for 2023 is calculated by dividing $61,500 by 52 weeks. This means the maximum weekly amount for 2023 is $1,182.69.\nFamily supplement\nIf your net family income doesn't exceed $25,921 per year, you have children and you or your spouse receive the Canada Child Tax Benefit, you're considered a member of a low-income family. Therefore, you may be eligible to receive the EI family supplement.\nThe family supplement rate is based on your net family income up to a maximum of $25,921 per year and the number of children in the family and their ages.\nThe family supplement may increase your benefit rate up to 80% of your average insurable earnings. If you and your spouse claim EI benefits at the same time,\u00a0only one of you\u00a0can receive the family supplement. It is generally better for\u00a0the spouse with the lower benefit rate\u00a0to receive the supplement.\nIf your income increases, the family supplement will gradually decrease. If you go over the maximum income of $25,921, you'll no longer receive the supplement.\nTaxable EI benefits\nEI benefits are taxable, no matter what type of benefits you receive. Federal and provincial or territorial taxes, where applicable, will therefore be deducted from your payment.\nBenefit duration\nIf you qualify for fishing benefits, you may receive up to 26 weeks of benefits within a period of 37 or 38 weeks, depending on the day of the week on which April 1 or October 1 falls. This period is called the benefit period.\nBenefit period\nThe benefit period for a\u00a0winter claim\u00a0can start as early as the week of April 1 and must end no later than the week of December 15.\nThe benefit period for a\u00a0summer claim\u00a0can start as early as the week of October 1 and must end no later than the week of June 15.\nThe benefit period can be extended to a maximum of 52 weeks if you're claiming EI special benefits such as sickness benefits. The benefit period is extended by one week for each week of special benefits claimed.\nDocument navigation\nPrevious: Do you qualify\nNext: Apply\nReport a problem or mistake on this page\nPlease select all that apply:\nA link, button or video is not working\nIt has a spelling mistake\nInformation is missing\nInformation is outdated or wrong\nLogin error when trying to access an account\nI can't find what I'm looking for\nOther issue not in this list\nSubmit\nThank you for your help!\nYou will not receive a reply.

If you\u2019re not eligible, we\u2019ll notify you of the decision made about your application.\nWaiting period\nBefore you start receiving Employment Insurance (EI) benefits, there is 1 week for which you won\u2019t be paid. This is called the waiting period. It\u2019s like the deductible that you must pay for other types of insurance.\nAny money you earn during the 1-week waiting period will be deducted from your benefit payment during the first 3 weeks for which benefits are paid. Once these 3 weeks have passed, the waiting period has no further effect on your benefits.\nTo receive your payment, you must complete an EI report (online or by telephone) every 2 weeks. You can\u2019t receive your payment unless you complete these reports.\nAccess code\nOnce your application is received, we'll mail you a benefit statement with a 4-digit access code. You\u2019ll need this code and your social insurance number (SIN) to follow up on your application. Receiving an EI benefit statement doesn't mean that we've made a decision about your claim.\nTo find out more about the fishing benefit, please read the Fishers and Employment Insurance guide, contact your nearest Service Canada office or call our EI Telephone Information Service at 1-800-206-7218 for service in English; 1-800-808-6352 for service in French (TTY: 1-800-529-3742).\nIf you disagree with the decision about your application for EI benefits\nYou can request a reconsideration of the decision. You must submit a request for reconsideration within 30 days after the day the decision was communicated to you. You can contact Service Canada to help you with your reconsideration request.\nWhile on EI\nYou can\u2019t work full time and receive EI benefits. However, you can work part time while receiving benefits.\nYou\u2019ll be able to keep 50 cents of your EI benefits for every dollar you earn, up to 90% of the weekly insurable earnings used to calculate your EI benefit amount, if you work while receiving fishing benefits and have served your waiting period. If you earn any money above this 90%, we\u2019ll deduct it dollar for dollar from your benefits.\nFor more information, visit the\u00a0Working While on Claim page.\nYou must report all gross earnings\u2014that is, earnings before taxes and deductions\u2014during the week you earn them, as well as any other money you receive while collecting fishing benefits.\nReceiving fishing and other types of EI benefits in the same claim period\nUnder certain conditions, you may receive fishing benefits and maternity, parental, sickness and/or family caregiver benefits during the same claim period. In this case, the benefit period would be extended to a maximum of 52 weeks, and you could receive up to 50 weeks of benefits.\nThe only exception is when EI fishing benefits and extended parental benefits are paid. As extended parental benefits are paid at a benefit rate of 33% of your weekly insurable earnings, up to a maximum amount, once 50 weeks of benefits have been paid, the weeks of extended parental benefits will be converted to an equivalent number of weeks that would have been paid at the 55% benefit rate. This conversion will determine how many more weeks of fishing benefits and special benefits can be paid to reach the equivalent of 50 weeks paid at the 55% benefits rate. Any weeks where you return to work during this period will be considered weeks paid for the purposes of calculating the equivalent of 50 weeks paid at the 55% benefit rate. Once the number of additional weeks that can be paid is determined, the benefit period will be extended to allow for the additional weeks to be paid.\nIt is important to note that if you haven\u2019t been paid any fishing or regular benefits during your benefit period, you may be able to receive up to 102 weeks of maternity, parental, sickness and/or family caregiver benefits in the same benefit period.\nTo find out whether you\u2019re eligible to receive other types of EI benefits in the same benefit period, please call our EI Telephone Information Service at 1-800-206-7218 (TTY: 1-800-529-3742) between 8:30 am and 4:30 pm, Monday to Friday. You can also write to us or go in person to your Service Canada Centre.\nTravelling outside Canada\nUsually, you can\u2019t receive EI benefits while outside Canada. One measure we take to enforce this rule is to compare EI information with information from the Canada Border Services Agency. If we find you have been out of the country while collecting fishing benefits, we will try to determine whether you are entitled to those benefits. If not, we will calculate your overpayment, which you will then have to repay.\nWe may also impose penalties of up to 3 times your weekly benefit rate or 3 times the amount of your overpayment. As well, you may have to earn more to qualify for fishing benefits in the future.\nRepaying benefits at income tax time\nWhen you file your income tax return, you may be required to repay some of the EI benefits you received. This will depend on your net income and whether you were paid EI regular non-fishing or regular fishing benefits during the tax year.\nFor more information, visit the EI and overpayments page or call our EI Telephone Information Service at 1-800-206-7218 (TTY: 1-800-529-3742). You can also write to us or visit us in person at a Service Canada Centre.\nProtecting Employment Insurance\nWe work to protect the EI program from misuse. One of the ways we do this is by working with employers and claimants to ensure the accuracy of the information we receive. With your help, we can reduce the amount of misuse and ensure that the EI program is used as it should be\u2014as a program that provides temporary financial assistance to individuals who qualify.\nA mistake is an unintentional act. We know claimants can make mistakes when filing their reports. Common mistakes include:\nestimating weekly earnings instead of putting in the actual amount earned\nforgetting to declare all the earnings received\nwriting or entering the wrong number when reporting earnings, or\nadding the number of hours or amount of earnings incorrectly\nSome mistakes can delay benefit payments, while others can affect the amount of benefits you receive\u2014meaning you were paid more or less than you were entitled to receive.\nFor example, estimating your earnings can have the following effects:\nif you estimated your earnings for 1 week and your estimate was higher than the earnings you actually received, your benefit amount will be less than it should have been. If this happens, let us know and we will adjust your file to make sure you receive all the benefits to which you are entitled, or\nif you estimated your earnings for 1 week and your estimate was lower than the earnings you actually received, your benefit amount will be higher than it should have been. Let us know if this happens. You\u2019ll have to repay the excess amount, but we\u2019ll ensure that repaying it causes no undue hardship. As well, we\u2019ll adjust your file to reflect your accurate information\nIf you notice a mistake on a completed form or report, or if there is a change in your circumstances that could affect your EI claim, tell Service Canada immediately. This will help prevent any future problems with your claim.\nMisrepresentation\nIf you knowingly withhold information, make misleading statements, or misrepresent the facts to make a false claim for benefits, this is considered misrepresentation. You could face severe monetary penalties or prosecution. This could also affect your future benefits. However, if you disclose your actions to Service Canada before an investigation begins, we may waive any monetary penalties and prosecutions that might otherwise apply.\nConsequences of misrepresentation: Interest and penalties\nInterest on debt\nWhen EI claimants receive benefits to which they\u2019re not entitled, the amount of the overpayment counts as a debt that must be repaid.\nWe charge interest on this debt when it results from claimants who knowingly withhold information or make false or misleading representations or statements. However, we do not charge interest on debt that results when we make an error in the benefit payment.\nThe rate of interest is the Bank of Canada average rate plus 3%. Interest is calculated daily and compounded monthly.\nPenalties\nA penalty may be imposed on a claimant, an employer, or an individual acting on their behalf in relation to a claim for benefits when he or she has:\nknowingly made false or misleading representations or statements, or\ncompleted a statement without declaring essential information\nHere is an example of a situation where penalties may be imposed:\nAn EI benefit claimant goes on an ocean cruise for a month and arranges for a friend to conceal their absence by signing and returning 2 EI claimant reports. As a result, the claimant illegally received $350 in benefits for each of the 4 weeks of the cruise. After investigation, we find that this was the first time the claimant and the friend had misused the EI system. As well, we find that they both knew that what they did was illegal but they did it anyway.\nIn this case, the claimant will have to repay $1,400 (4 weeks of benefits at $350 per week) and may have to pay a penalty of $700 ($350 for each of the 2 false reports filed during the holiday). The friend may also have to pay a penalty of $700 for the illegal act of filing 2 false reports on behalf of the claimant.\nThere are many situations when a penalty may apply, and the amount could become very high. Depending on the circumstances, the maximum penalty could be up to 3 times the amount of the overpayment, 3 times the weekly benefit rate for each incident of misrepresentation, or 3 times the maximum benefit rate.\nViolations\nClaimants who misuse the EI program and were assessed a violation may need more insurable earnings or hours to qualify for benefits in the future. The required amount rises based on the number and seriousness of misrepresentations that have been recorded in the 5-year period before the start of their claims.\nRights and responsibilities\nThe EI program guarantees certain rights. There are also some basic responsibilities, for both you and Service Canada.\nWhen you apply for EI benefits, you must:\nbe capable of and available for work and unable to obtain suitable employment\nactively search for and accept offers of suitable employment\nconduct job search activities that increase your opportunities to find suitable employment, such as:\nassessing employment opportunities\npreparing a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or cover letter\nregistering for job search tools or with electronic job banks or employment agencies\nattending job search workshops or job fairs\nnetworking\ncontacting prospective employers\nsubmitting job applications\nattending interviews\nundergoing evaluations of competencies\nkeep a detailed record as proof of your job search efforts to find suitable employment as we may ask you to provide that proof at any time.

You are entitled to claim regular benefits, as well as maternity, parental, sickness, compassionate care and family caregiver benefits.\nEligibility details\nThe regular eligibility period during which you can claim EI parental benefits starts during the week of birth for a newborn, or the week a child is placed with you for adoption. This period continues for the 52 weeks that follow in the case of standard parental benefits, or for the 78 weeks that follow in the case of extended parental benefits.\nYou can claim up to 35 weeks of EI standard parental benefits within this 52-week eligibility period, or 61 weeks of extended parental benefits, within this 78-week eligibility period. An extra 5 weeks of standard, or 8 weeks of extended, parental benefits is available if you share benefits with the other parent(s). One parent cannot take more than 35 weeks of standard or 61 weeks of extended parental benefits.\nTo provide more flexibility for Canadian Forces members, either of these EI parental benefit eligibility periods can be extended up to a maximum of 104 weeks.\nThis extension is available to Canadian Forces members who cannot collect all their parental benefits during the regular eligibility period because of an imperative military requirement as confirmed by the Department of National Defence. The imperative military requirement can either defer or interrupt their parental leave.\nExamples\nPaul, a Canadian Forces member, is entitled to 61 weeks of EI extended parental benefits after the birth of his daughter. After 15 weeks of parental leave, however, Paul is recalled to duty because of an imperative military requirement, which lasts 20 weeks. If he had not been recalled to duty, he would have been entitled to receive EI extended parental benefits for those 20 weeks. Paul's eligibility period for EI parental benefits can be extended by the full 20 weeks after he returns from the imperative military requirement\nKyana is a Canadian Forces member who adopted a child on September 8, 2016. She requested 37 weeks of parental leave from the Department of National Defence, starting on December 4, 2016. However, on November 6, 2016, she had to leave for a mission on an imperative military requirement. As a result, she could not start her parental leave as planned. Her leave was deferred until the date that she returned, which was March 25, 2017. If Kyana's parental leave had not been deferred, she would have been entitled to EI standard parental benefits for those 16 weeks. Kyana's eligibility period for EI standard parental benefits can be extended by the full 16 weeks after she returns from the imperative military requirement\nOther conditions you have to meet to take advantage of the extended eligibility period for EI parental benefits\nAs a Canadian Forces member, you have to:\nformally request your EI parental leave from the Department of National Defence before you leave for the imperative military requirement, or\nprovide the dates you intended to take your EI parental leave, if you are already on the imperative military requirement\nWhat you need before you start\nWhen an imperative military requirement either defers or interrupts your EI parental leave, the Department of National Defence will complete a form called \"PATA Extension \u2013 Imperative Military Requirement\" and will give you a copy of the completed form.\nTo complete the online EI application, you will need the following personal information:\nyour social insurance number (SIN)\nif your SIN begins with a 9, you will need to provide proof of your immigration status and work permit\nthe last name at birth of one of your parents\nyour mailing and residential addresses, including the postal codes\u2014if you do not have a usual place of residence, you must apply in person at your local Service Canada Centre and\nyour complete banking information to sign up for direct deposit, including:\nyour financial institution name\nyour bank branch number\nyour account number\nWhen you apply for EI parental benefits, you must provide:\nthe date of birth of your newborn or, in the case of an adoption, the date on which your child was placed with you (you must also provide the full name and address of the agency handling the adoption)\nthe SIN of the other parent, if you plan to share the benefits\nAfter you apply\nAfter you apply for EI parental benefits, you must then contact Service Canada at 1 800 206 7218 to provide the information contained in the completed PATA Extension\u2014Imperative Military Requirement form.\nCanadian Forces members living in Quebec\nCanadian Forces members residing in Quebec will continue to collect parental benefits from the existing Quebec Parental Insurance Plan.

Under the Employment Insurance Act, CRA is responsible for determining whether or not your employment is insurable.\nEligibility details\nThe following eligibility criteria for farmers for Employment Insurance (EI) benefits are based on insurable employment.\nYou may be eligible for EI benefits if you meet the following criteria:\nyou have accumulated enough insurable hours to qualify for EI benefits, even if you have self-employment earnings\nyou meet the entitlement criteria for the type of EI benefit you applied to receive\nyou demonstrate that you are unemployed through no fault of your own for each week you claim EI benefits\nyou are actively looking for another job and are ready, willing, and capable of working each day (in the case of EI regular benefits)\nyour farming activities (self-employment) are determined to be minor in extentFootnote 3\nYou are not entitled to EI benefits if you are working a full work weekFootnote 4. If your main source of income is from operating a business, including farming, and your self-employment/farming activities are not considered to be minor in extent, you are considered to be working a full work week. Therefore, you are not unemployed.\nAs a self-employed farmer, you are considered to be working a full work week during the period from April 1 to September 1. However, during the period between the week of October 1 and the week following March 31, you may be able to receive EI benefits if you accumulated insurable hours elsewhere while working for an employer and your self-employment activities on the farm are so small that it is not your principal means of living during that period.\nWhat you need before you start\nyour social insurance number\u00a0(SIN)\nif your SIN begins with a \u201c9,\u201d you must provide proof of your immigration status and your work permit\nthe last name at birth of one of your parents\nyour mailing and residential addresses, including the postal codes\nyour complete banking information to sign up for direct deposit, including:\nthe name of your financial institution\nyour bank branch number\nyour account number\nthe names, addresses, dates of employment, and\u00a0reason\u00a0for separation for all your employers for the last 52 weeks\nyour detailed version of facts if you quit or were dismissed from any job in the last 52\u00a0weeks\nthe dates (Sunday to Saturday) and earnings for each of your highest paid weeks of insurable earnings in the last 52 weeks or since the start of your last EI claim, whichever is the shorter of these 2 periods\nthis information will be used, along with your record(s) of employment, to calculate your weekly EI benefit rate\nYou may also have to provide the following details if you are reactivating an existing claim:\nthe salary amount you received, before deductions, for the last week you worked (from Sunday to your last day of work), including tips and commissions\nany other amounts you received or will receive, such as:\nvacation pay\nseverance pay\npension payments\npay in lieu of notice\nother money\nYou may also have to gather the following related information, depending on your situation:\nif you are applying for parental benefits, you must provide the SIN of the other parent\nif you are applying for sickness benefits, you must obtain a medical certificate\nif you are applying for caregiving benefits, you must provide a medical certificate and information about the person needing care or support, such as first and last name, date of birth, and residential address\nStart Application\nAfter you submit your application\nShortly after applying for EI, you will receive a benefit statement in the mail.

For more information on reporting, visit Employment Insurance reporting.\nUse your access code to register for a My Service Canada Account, where you can view and update your EI information.\nAdditional information\nService Canada will let you know in writing if you are entitled to receive EI benefits. If you disagree with the decision, you have the right to request a reconsideration.\nYou can work while receiving EI benefits, but you must report your earnings and hours worked. Your benefits may be reduced due to these earnings and hours.\nEarnings that you receive as a result of operating a farm are considered to be self-employment earnings.\nTo find out more about the Farming Benefit, please read the guide EI and self-employed, farmers and independent workers , contact your nearest Service Canada office or call our EI Telephone Information Service at 1-800-206-7218 (TTY: 1-800-529-3742).\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nFarmer \u2013 either an individual working alone or an individual engaged in a partnership, corporation, or cooperative association who is or intends to be engaged in farming in Canada.\nReturn to footnote 1 referrer\nFootnote 2\nFarming \u2013 involves producing field-grown and horticultural crops (cultivated and uncultivated), raising livestock, poultry, and fur-bearing animals, producing eggs, milk, honey, maple syrup, tobacco, fibre, wood from woodlots, and fodder crops, and producing or raising any other prescribed thing or animal.\nReturn to footnote 2 referrer\nFootnote 3\nMinor in extent \u2013 the work you do is so minimal that you are unable to make a living from it.\nSix factors are considered to determine the extent of your self-employment activities when you apply for EI benefits.

The date your application form is received may affect the date your benefit begins. Do not wait for your completed medical form before sending your completed application form.\nHowever, a decision on your application can only be made when you have sent both of the following:\na complete application form (including questionnaire and signed consent form)\na signed medical report\nFor eligible disabilities, we aim to make a decision on your eligibility within 120 calendar days (4 months).\nIf we confirm your condition is grave, we aim to process your application within 30 calendar days.\nIf we confirm you have a terminal illness, we aim to process your application within 5 business days.\nDefinitions\nSubstantially gainful work\nSubstantially gainful work is a job that pays wages equal to or greater than the maximum annual amount a person could receive as a disability pension. In 2023, this amount is $18,508.36 (before tax).\nOnce you have earned $6,600 (before tax) in 2023, you must contact Service Canada. Your disability benefits may be impacted by your gross (before tax) earnings:\nif you earn below $6,600 (before tax), this alone should not affect your disability benefits\nif you earn between $6,600 and $18,508.36 (before tax), this may show that you are regularly capable of working and it may affect your disability benefits\nif you earn $18,508.36 (before tax) or more, this demonstrates you are regularly capable of working and you will likely no longer qualify for disability benefits\nYou need to advise Service Canada when you reach any of these amounts and you should call when you start working.\u00a0This does not necessarily mean that your benefits will stop. When reviewing your file, we will consider the factors listed above (hours, regularity, etc.). By contacting us, we can provide you with information about our work-related supports and services.\nTerminal illness\nA terminal medical condition is a disease state that cannot be cured or adequately treated and is reasonably expected to result in death within 6 months.\nGrave condition\nA grave condition is a rapidly progressive medical condition.

It is intended for Canada Pension Plan (CPP) retirement pension beneficiaries found to be disabled but not eligible for a disability pension due to being CPP retirement pension beneficiaries for more than 15 months. Applicants who have made sufficient contributions may be eligible for this benefit in addition to their retirement pension.\nStep 2 Eligibility\nThe eligibility criteria are the same as for the Canada Pension Plan disability pension. You must:\nbe under the age of 65\nhave a severe and prolonged mental or physical medical condition, according to the definition in the Canada Pension Plan legislation\nmeet the minimum contributory requirements\nTo meet the minimum contributory requirements, you must:\nhave made valid contributions to the CPP in 4 of the last 6 years\nhave contributed for at least 25 years, including 3 of the last 6 years\nmeet the requirements for the late applicant provision\nIf you apply for CPP disability benefits but are not eligible because you have received the CPP retirement pension for more than 15 months, we will automatically consider your eligibility for the post-retirement disability benefit.\nStep 3 How to apply\nThere is no separate application for this benefit. You will have to complete a CPP disability benefits application.\nStep 4 How much you could receive\nThe amount of the Post-Retirement Disability Benefit is the flat rate component of the disability pension. For the current year the amount is $558.74 (2023).\nThis amount will be paid until age 65, at which point the PRDB payment stops and the person continues to receive the retirement pension.\nStep 5 How does the Post-Retirement Disability Benefit interact with your other benefits\nThe Post-Retirement Disability Benefit is paid in addition to the CPP retirement pension you are receiving, until the age of 65.\nIf you have any dependent children, a disabled contributor's child benefit is payable.\nCPP benefits may affect the income you receive from other programs. Some income-tested benefits take your CPP income into account, such as the War Veterans Allowance, Employment Insurance, the Guaranteed Income Supplement, the Allowance and the Allowance for the Survivor, as well as provincial and territorial social assistance (\"welfare\") and disability benefits and most workers' compensation programs. CPP benefits may also affect how much you get from your employer pension or private-sector disability insurance.\nReport a problem or mistake on this page\nPlease select all that apply:\nA link, button or video is not working\nIt has a spelling mistake\nInformation is missing\nInformation is outdated or wrong\nLogin error when trying to access an account\nI can't find what I'm looking for\nOther issue not in this list\nSubmit\nThank you for your help!\nYou will not receive a reply.

The tax rate is 25% unless reduced or exempted by a tax treaty between Canada and your country of residence. The non-resident tax will be deducted from your benefit payments.\nRequesting a reduction in the amount of non-resident tax withheld (form NR5)\nIf you live in a country with a tax treaty with Canada, you don't need to ask for taxes on your payments to be reduced or exempted. It will be done automatically when you file your income tax.\nIf you live in a country without a tax treaty or if you want less tax to be withheld from your monthly payments, you may ask for your taxes to be reduced or eliminated from your benefit payment by completing the Application by a Non-Resident of Canada for a Reduction in the Amount of Non-Resident Tax Required to be Withheld (NR5) . The NR5 should be received by October 31 if you want less tax to be withheld in the following year starting in January. If late, your application cannot be accepted. Once approved, the NR5 is valid for five years unless your income changes. Note, however, that you must still file an income tax return each taxation year. Also, if you already have an NR5 for one pension and you start to receive a second pension, you must complete a new NR5.\nOAS recovery tax\nIf your annual income is higher than the net world threshold, for example $72,809 for the 2015 tax year, you may be subject to the Old Age Security \"recovery tax\", and you may have to repay part or all of your OAS pension.\nThe Canada Revenue Agency tells Service Canada how much tax to withhold from your OAS benefit based on the Old Age Security Return of Income (OASRI) you filed. The recovery tax plus the non-resident tax withheld cannot be more than the amount of the OAS benefits received in the year. You will receive an advisory letter from Service Canada before July 1, showing you the recovery tax deductions, if any, that are being withheld from your OAS pension payments.\nIf you reside in a country that has a tax treaty with Canada, you may be exempt from paying the recovery tax.\nFiling your taxes\nAs a non-resident pensioner who receives OAS payments, unless you resided in one of these countries in 2014, you must submit an Old Age Security Return of Income (OASRI) before April 30th so that the Canada Revenue Agency can determine if you have to pay the recovery tax. This will also ensure that your OAS payments are not interrupted. The recovery tax is calculated using the net world income that you report on this return.\nIf you are a resident of a country with which Canada has a tax treaty, you may not have to file this return. For more information on this exception, see the list of tax treaty countries.\nNR4 tax information slips\nEarly each year, if you are living outside Canada, you will receive a NR4 tax information slip showing the amount of CPP or OAS payments you received during the previous year. You must include this slip when you file your annual income tax return.\nYou can view your NR4 tax information slips online as early as February 1.\nIf you have not signed up to view them online, we will send your CPP or OAS tax information slips by mail, in February. If you do not receive your tax slips by February 28, contact International Social Security Agreements.\nMore tax information\nSee the Canada Revenue Agency web site for \"Non-Resident Seniors\" for other useful tax information for non-residents. If you have tax-related questions, you can also contact a Canada Revenue Agency International Tax Services Office.\nHow are my foreign benefits taxed if I live in Canada?\nSee the Canada Revenue Agency web page on \"Pensions from a Foreign Country\" for taxation information.\nNon-Resident Tax Rates by Country\nIf you live outside Canada, a non-resident tax is withheld from your monthly Old Age Security (OAS) and Canada Pension Plan (CPP) or Quebec Pension Plan (QPP) payments.\nThe standard non-resident tax rate is 25%. However, Canada has tax treaties with some countries that affect the amount of non-resident tax withheld.\nThis table shows the tax rate that applies to your country of residence as well as any applicable exemption.\nNon-Resident Tax Rates by Country\nCountry of residence\nOAS benefits\nCPP or QPP pensions\nCPP or QPP death benefits\nApplicable exemptions\nArgentina\n15%\n15%\n25%\nAustralia\n15%\n15%\n15%\nAzerba\u00efjan\n15%\n15%\n25%\nYou are exempt from tax on the first CAN $12,000 (or its equivalent in the country's currency) of the total of your pensions from Canada (except for CPP or QPP death benefits).

It can also reduce or eliminate restrictions based on citizenship or on payment of pensions abroad.\nNote: Possible eligibility for more than one benefit\nYou may be eligible for a foreign pension, a Canadian pension, or both.\nCanadian benefits\nIf you have lived and/or worked in Canada and in another country, and do not meet the contributory\nor residence requirement for a Canada Pension Plan or Old Age Security benefit, a social security agreement may help you qualify. It might also provide benefits to your surviving spouse, common law partner or children.\nThe Canadian benefits included in Canada\u2019s international social security agreements are those paid under the Old Age Security program and the Canada Pension Plan program.\nA social security agreement may help you qualify for a Canadian or foreign benefit, or both, if you lived or worked abroad and in Canada.\nTo help you qualify for a Canadian pension or benefit:\nyour periods of contribution under the legislation of another country may be considered as periods of contribution to the Canada Pension Plan (CPP).\nyour periods of residency and contribution under the legislation of another country, also known as creditable periods, may be considered as periods of residency in Canada for the Old Age Security (OAS) program depending on the agreement.\nExample 1\nThomas, 65, lived in Austria for much of his life. He lived in Canada for 16 years after the age of 18. This year, he moved back to Austria to be nearer his aging parents. Normally 20 years of residence in Canada is needed to receive an OAS pension outside Canada, so Thomas would normally not have qualified. However, the social security agreement with Austria allows him to count the time he lived in Austria after age 18 towards meeting the 20 -year residence-in-Canada requirement. Thomas will receive a partial OAS pension outside Canada for the rest of his life.\nNote that while the social security agreement helped qualify Thomas to receive an OAS pension, the payment amount is determined by the numbers of years of residence in Canada after age 18. Having lived in Canada for 16 years, Thomas will receive 16/40ths of the full OAS pension.\nExample 2\nLiam was born in Ireland and worked there for 20 years before moving to Canada at the age of 40. Liam worked in Canada and contributed to the CPP for 5 years prior to his death at age 46. For Liam\u2019s spouse and child to be eligible for CPP death and survivor benefits, Liam needed to have contributed to the CPP for 10 years. (You have to contribute to the CPP for at least one-third of all the years of your \u201ccontributory period\u201d.) Because Liam contributed to the CPP for only 5 years, his survivors would normally not be entitled to death or survivor benefits. However, the social security agreement with Ireland allows his periods of contribution to the Irish pension program to be considered as periods of contribution to the CPP in order to satisfy the minimum qualifying period of 10 years. Since Liam\u2019s spouse and child meet the age requirements, they will be entitled to CPP death and survivor benefits.\nNote that, while the social security agreement helped Liam\u2019s spouse and child to qualify for CPP benefits, the payment amounts will be based on the actual contributions Liam made to the CPP.\nForeign benefits\nThe foreign benefits covered by Canada\u2019s international social security agreements vary from agreement to agreement. It is important to check the details of the agreement that relates to you.\nTo help you qualify for a foreign pension or benefit:\nyour periods of contribution to the Canada Pension Plan or periods of residence in Canada may be considered as periods of contribution or residence under a foreign social security program.\nExample 3\nChristine, from Winnipeg, lived in Canada until she was 30 when she accepted a job at an international engineering firm in Barbados. She worked there for 7 years and then decided to return to Canada. Because she did not contribute to the Barbadian social security scheme for the minimum period of time, she would normally not qualify for a Barbadian retirement pension. So her contributions to the Barbadian pension plan would have been lost. However, Canada\u2019s social security agreement with Barbados allows her to combine her periods of contribution to the Canada Pension Plan with her periods of contribution to the Barbadian social security scheme in order to meet the minimum requirement. Later, when she is ready to apply for her Barbadian pension, it will be based on those 7 years of contributions to the Barbadian social security scheme.\n(And, when she is ready to apply for her Canada Pension Plan retirement pension, it will be based on her years of contributions to the CPP.

That person is responsible for things such as:\nsupervising the child\u2019s daily activities and needs\nmaking sure the child\u2019s medical needs are met\narranging for child care when necessary\nWhen there is a female parent who lives with the child\nWhen two individuals who are spouses or common-law partners reside in the same home as the child, the female parent is presumed to be primarily responsible for the care and upbringing of all the children in the home. She should be the one applying for the CCB. The female presumption is a legislative requirement and only one payment per household can be issued under the Income Tax Act. No matter which parent receives the CCB, the amount will be the same.\nHowever, if the other parent is primarily responsible, they should apply and attach a signed letter from the female parent stating that they are primarily responsible for the care and upbringing of all the children in the home.\nIf the child resides with same-sex parents, only one parent should apply for all the children in the home.\nChild custody arrangements and your benefits\nIf a child only lives with you part of the time, you need to determine if you are considered to have shared custody.\nDetermine if you have shared custody\nDoes the child spend their time:\nabout equally between you and another individual (between 40% and 60%)\nIf the child lives with you at least 40% of the time or on an approximately equal basis with you and another individual at a different address, then both individuals are considered to have shared custody for the purposes of the CCB.\nFor example, the child lives with you one week and with another individual one week, or with you 4 days a week and with the other individual 3 days a week (between 40% and 60%).\nBoth individuals should apply for the CCB for the child in shared custody\nShared custody and your payments\nmostly with you (more than 60% of the time)\nIf the child lives with you more than 60% of the time, you are considered to have full custody for the purposes of the CCB.\nFor example, the child lives with you during the week and with another individual every second weekend.\nYou should apply for the CCB for the child\nmostly with another individual (less than 40% of the time with you)\nIf the child lives less than 40% of the time with you and mostly with another individual, you are not considered an eligible individual for the purposes of the CCB and should not apply.\nFor example, the child lives with you every second weekend.\nmostly with another individual, but for a temporary period mostly with you (e.g. summer period)\nChanges in custody can sometimes be temporary. This can happen, for example, if the child usually lives with one individual, but goes to live with another individual for the summer.\nIn these cases, the individual that gets custody on a temporary basis can apply to get CCB payments for that period. When the child returns to live with the other individual, they need to reapply to start getting the payments again.\nIf you start or end a shared custody situation, let the CRA know that your situation changed.\nReport a problem or mistake on this page\nPlease select all that apply:\nA link, button or video is not working\nIt has a spelling mistake\nInformation is missing\nInformation is outdated or wrong\nLogin error when trying to access an account (e.g. My Service Canada Account)\nGC Key access\nSecureKey Concierge (Banking Credential) access\nPersonal Access Code (PAC) problems or EI Access Code (AC) problems\nSocial Insurance Number (SIN) validation problems\nOther login error not in this list\nI can't find what I'm looking for\nOther issue not in this list\nSubmit\nThank you for your help!\nYou will not receive a reply.

There was a bit of a change in how the industry perceived it. There was a bit of a separation between the funeral industry and the family support industry and that changed for me because it meant my position really wasn't required. I really had to just go about developing a business model that let me find different ways to find clients. There is definitely a moment of fear when you find out that you have really been left to sort of fend for yourself. How am I going to pay my bills? Have I got enough savings to get me through this? I wasn't aware of the CWB program at all until I discovered it when I was doing income taxes for the year, did a quick little bit of research, found out exactly that I was who it was for. It's a great benefit to get someone through a difficult financial time. I was completely eligible and it was really very simple. It's done right on the tax return. I think the fact that there is an advance payment opportunity with the Canada workers benefit may make the program even more beneficial to some people.\n[text on screen]: Every dollar counts.\n[text on screen]: Find out if you qualify for the Canada workers benefit at\ncanada.ca/canada-workers-benefit\nReport a problem or mistake on this page\nPlease select all that apply:\nA link, button or video is not working\nIt has a spelling mistake\nInformation is missing\nInformation is outdated or wrong\nLogin error when trying to access an account\nI can't find what I'm looking for\nOther issue not in this list\nSubmit\nThank you for your help!\nYou will not receive a reply.

You can't receive these benefits more than 17 weeks after your due date or the date you gave birth, whichever is later. A maximum of 15 weeks of benefits is available.\nWhen you apply for maternity benefits, you can also apply for parental benefits. This will save you time later.\nParental benefits\nYou can start receiving parental benefits the week your child is born or placed with you for the purpose of adoption.\nWhen applying for parental benefits, you need to choose between 2 options:\nstandard parental (up to 35 weeks, up to $638 a week)\nextended parental (up to 61 weeks, up to $383 a week)\nIf you applied for parental benefits at the same time as maternity benefits, you don't need to apply again.\nOnce you start receiving parental benefits, you can't change options.\nSharing parental benefits\nIf sharing benefits, each parent must choose the same option, standard or extended. Each parent must submit their own application. If parents don't choose the same option, the choice on the first application received is used to determine the parental benefit option for all parents.\nWhen sharing, the maximum number of weeks available increases to:\n40 weeks for standard parental\n69 weeks for extended parental\nOne parent can't receive more than 35 weeks of standard or 61 weeks of extended parental benefits. The remaining 5 weeks of standard or 8 weeks of extended parental benefits are available on a use-it-or-lose-it basis: if taken, they can only be taken by the other parent(s).\nParents can receive their weeks of benefits at the same time or one after another.\nExamples\nMaternity plus standard parental benefits\nJulie and David are having a baby. Julie takes the full 15 weeks of maternity benefits she is entitled to. She and David each decide to take 20 weeks of standard parental benefits at the same time to care for their child.\nExtended parental benefits\nSami and Alex are adopting a child.

Check with your employer to find out if they offer a top-up.\nIf your weekly earnings vary or your income changes\nTo calculate your benefit amount, we use a specific number of your highest paid weeks of employment. We call these your best weeks. The number of best weeks we use is based on the unemployment rate where you live. It could be between 14 and 22 weeks.\nIf your weekly earnings vary or your income changes, your best weeks can impact your benefit amount.\nEstimate your benefits\nAnswer the questions below to estimate your benefits, or find out what we use to calculate your benefits.\nFind your economic region to learn how many best weeks are used to calculate your benefit amount.

Be under the age of 65\nYou can receive CPP disability benefits only until you are 65.\n2. Meet the minimum contributory requirements\nTo meet the minimum contributory requirements, you must:\nhave made valid contributions to the CPP in 4 of the last 6 years, or\nhave contributed for at least 25 years, including 3 of the last 6 years, or\nmeet the requirements for the late applicant provision\nHow CPP contributions work\nThe Canada Pension Plan operates everywhere in Canada, except in Quebec, where the Quebec Pension Plan (QPP) applies.\nYou automatically contribute to the CPP, based on what you earn above $3,500 to a maximum annual amount. This annual amount is called pensionable earnings. The maximum amount is set each January, based on the average wage in Canada.\nYou do not contribute:\nwhile you receive CPP disability benefits\nduring periods when you have no earnings, or\nwhen your annual earnings are $3,500 or less\nYour contributory period\nYour contributory period starts when you reach age 18. Your contributory period ends when you start receiving your CPP retirement pension, turn 70, or die (whichever happens first).\nService Canada uses the contributory period to:\ndetermine if you meet the CPP contribution requirements, and\ncalculate the amount of CPP benefits you are eligible to receive\nService Canada looks at:\nhow long you contribute, and\nhow much you contribute to the CPP\nThe more you earn and contribute to the CPP, the higher your payment will be.\nNote\nWith very few exceptions, everyone over the age of 18 who works in Canada outside of Quebec and earns more than the Disability Basic Exemption ($6,600 per year in 2023) makes a valid contribution toward CPP disability benefits.\n3. Have a mental or physical disability that regularly stops you from doing any type of substantially gainful work\nTo receive these benefits, you must have a mental or physical disability that regularly stops you from doing any type of work. This means that your disability usually or always prevents you from doing any substantially gainful work. Work capacity can be demonstrated through paid work, volunteer activities, educational activities, or any combination of these activities. Your condition must be both severe and prolonged when you apply.\nWhat does the CPP mean by severe\nA person is considered to have a severe disability if they are regularly incapable of pursuing any substantially gainful occupation.\nBeing regularly incapable means that you are usually or always incapable. A Service Canada medical adjudicator will determine whether you meet this requirement.\nAn occupation is any profession or work a person might do to earn a living. If the total annual amount of earnings from this work is more than 12 times the maximum monthly CPP disability benefit amount, the work is considered to be substantially gainful.\nWhat does CPP mean by prolonged\nYour disability is long-term and of indefinite duration or is likely to result in death.\nBeing eligible for a disability benefits from other government programs or from private insurers does not automatically mean you are eligible for CPP disability benefits.\nPost-retirement disability benefit\nThe CPP post-retirement disability benefit is intended for people receiving the CPP retirement pension who are. You can get this monthly payment if you:\nare under the age of 65\nhave made the minimum amount of valid CPP and/or Quebec Pension Plan (QPP) contributions\nhave a mental and/or physical medical condition(s) that prevents you from regularly working at any substantially gainful job. Your medical condition(s) must be found to be both severe and prolonged as defined by the CPP, and\nare already receiving the CPP retirement pensions for more than 15 months or become disabled after starting to receive your retirement pension\nThe post-retirement disability benefit amount is equal to the flat-rate portion of the disability benefit and will increase in January every year with the cost of living. In 2023 it is $558.74.\nChildren of someone receiving this benefit may be eligible for the disabled contributor's children's benefit.\nThe post-retirement disability benefit ends:\nthe month you turns 65, or\nthe month you are no longer deemed to be disabled, or\nthe month of death\nCPP disability benefits eligibility map\nIf you have any questions about your eligibility or continuing eligibility, please contact Service Canada.

When you work in Quebec you contribute to the Quebec Pension Plan (QPP) instead of to the CPP.\nYou must apply for QPP disability benefits if:\nyou worked only in Quebec, or\nyou currently live in Quebec and have contributed to both the CPP and QPP, or\nyou have worked in Quebec, currently live outside Canada and your last province of residence was Quebec\nIf you have a terminal illness\nFor the purposes of CPP, a terminal medical condition is a disease state that cannot be cured or adequately treated and is reasonably expected to result in death within 6 months. There is a different application form to complete: the Terminal Illness Application for a Disability Benefit under the Canada Pension Plan (ISP2530A).\nService Canada's goal is to process your application within 5 business days of receiving a complete terminal illness application. If employment or medical information is missing, the decision may take longer.\nIf you have a grave medical condition\nA grave condition is a rapidly progressive medical condition. A list of grave conditions was developed based on extensive research by ESDC. These conditions have a high probability of meeting the CPP disability eligibility criteria.\nOur goal is to make a decision for applicants with grave medical conditions within 30 calendar days. When you apply for CPP disability benefits with the Application for Canada Pension Plan Disability Benefits (ISP1151) and Medical Report for a Canada Pension Plan Disability Benefit (ISP2519), Service Canada will determine whether you have one of these conditions based on the information in the application.\nThe list of grave medical conditions can be found on the Canada Pension Plan disability benefits webpage.\nService Canada\u2019s Service Standards\nOur goal is to make a decision within these timeframes (all timeframes refer to calendar days, except for the terminal illness standard of 5 business days).\nCPP disability benefits application\nWithin 120 days of receiving a complete application.\nGrave medical condition(s)\nWithin 30 days of receiving a complete application.\nTerminal illness\nWithin 5 business days of receiving a complete application.\nReconsideration\nYou can request a reconsideration within 90 days of receiving the letter notifying you of the decision. Service Canada will inform you of the decision within 120 days of receiving your request for reconsideration.\nProvisions\nOne or more of the following provisions could help you qualify for CPP disability benefits or increase the amount you receive.\nChild-rearing provision\nIf you stopped working or worked less to care for a child under the age of 7, the child-rearing provision may help you qualify for CPP disability benefits or increase your benefit amount. The child-rearing provision allows you to not count a period of low earnings or no earnings when you were raising your child.\nThe child-rearing provision may apply to you if:\nyou did not work or had low earnings because you were the primary caregiver of your child under the age of 7, and\nyou have received Family Allowance payments or been eligible for the Canada child tax benefit or Canada child benefit (even if you did not receive the benefit)\nThe CPP considers the primary caregiver to be the person who is most responsible for the daily needs of the child (or children) until the age of 7.

The date your application form is received may affect the date your benefit begins. Do not wait for your completed medical form before sending your completed application form.\nHowever, a decision on your application can only be made when you have sent both of the following:\na complete application form (including questionnaire and signed consent form), and\na signed medical report\nWe aim to make a decision on your eligibility within 120 calendar days (4 months).\nIf we confirm your condition is grave, we aim to process your application within 30 calendar days.\nIf we confirm you have a terminal illness, we aim to process your application within 5 business days.\nWhen will I receive my benefit\nYour disability benefit payment usually begins in the 120 days after Service Canada determines that you are eligible for a CPP disability benefit. For example, if Service Canada determines that you were disabled in July, then you will start receiving your benefit payment in November.\nYou may receive up to 12 months of retroactive payments from the date your application was received.\nHow much can I receive\nYour decision letter will give you the amount of your monthly payment.\nThe basic payment amount is $558.74. We add to the basic amount based on how much you paid into the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) while you worked. With the introduction of CPP enhancement in 2019, the monthly maximum disability amount increases every month. In 2023, the monthly amount in January was $1,538.67 and will increase to $1,546.05 in December.\nThe post-retirement disability benefit is the same flat rate ($558.74 in 2023). It does not matter how much or for how long you contributed to the Canada Pension Plan.\nCPP disability payments are taxable income\nTaxes are not automatically deducted each month. You can ask that federal income tax be deducted from your monthly payment by:\nsigning into your My Service Canada Account\ncompleting the Request for voluntary Federal Income tax Deductions CPP/OAS (ISP-3520CPP) form and mailing it to us or dropping it off at a Service Canada office, or\ncalling Service Canada at 1-800-277-9914 or 1-800-255-4786 (TTY)\nIf you do not ask for monthly tax deductions, you may have to pay your income tax each quarter.\nReceiving disability income from another source\nIf you are receiving disability income from other sources, such as a private insurance company or a provincial or territorial social assistance program, you may still be eligible for CPP disability benefits, but the other sources may reduce their payments.\nContact your insurance company or social assistance program for details about your case.\nReceiving more than one Canada Pension Plan benefit\nIf you are eligible for both a CPP survivor\u2019s pension and a CPP disability pension, they will be combined into a single monthly payment. If you are eligible for the CPP post-retirement disability benefit, it will be paid as a separate monthly payment.\nIf you are receiving a combined retirement and survivor pension, and are then granted a post-retirement disability benefit, you will receive the higher amount of the survivor or post-retirement disability benefit flat rate.\nRequest for reconsideration\nIf you disagree with Service Canada's decision on your application for CPP disability benefits, you can ask for a reconsideration within 90 days of receiving a decision letter.\nWhat is a reconsideration\nA reconsideration is a review of your application by a Service Canada staff member who was not involved in making the original decision. They will also review any new information that you provide or others provide for you. Service Canada staff may also seek more medical information about your case.\nHow do I request a reconsideration\nThere are 3 ways to request a reconsideration:\nOption 1: submit your request online using My Service Canada Account (MSCA)\nOption 2: complete the Request for Reconsideration of a Canada Pension Plan Disability Decision form (ISP-1145) and mail it to the return address on the decision letter or bring it to a Service Canada office\nOption 3: write a letter to Service Canada and include:\nyour name\nyour address\nyour telephone number\nyour Social Insurance Number or Client Identification Number\na detailed explanation of why you do not agree with the decision\nany new information that could affect the decision, and\nyour signature and the date\nSubmit the letter:\nelectronically by signing into My Service Canada Account (MSCA)\nby mail to the return address on the decision letter, or\nin person at a Service Canada office\nReconsideration takes about 120 days.

You can log into your MSCA at any time to upload documents in support of your request.\nNote\nService Canada will start reviewing your request for reconsideration once we receive all the information.\nIf you disagree with the reconsideration decision\nIf you disagree with the reconsideration decision, the next step is to appeal to the Social Security Tribunal. To do this, complete the Canada Pension Plan Notice of Appeal \u2013 Income Security \u2013 General Division form.\nFor more information, contact the Social Security Tribunal:\nby email: info.sst-tss@canada.gc.ca\nby phone from 7\u00a0am to 7\u00a0pm Eastern time: Monday to Friday: 1-877-227-8577 (toll-free in Canada and the USA)\n613-437-1640 (from outside Canada and the USA, call collect)\nTTY: 1-866-873-8381\nExtension request\nIf you have already applied for CPP disability benefits but you have an upcoming medical appointment that might affect your eligibility, you can ask Service Canada to delay deciding whether you are eligible. You can ask for an extension the first time you apply or when you request a reconsideration. To request an extension, contact Service Canada.\nWhen do the benefits stop\nYour disability benefits will continue as long as you continue to have a severe and prolonged disability (according to the CPP), which prevents you from regularly working. CPP disability benefits are not necessarily permanent. They are long-term benefits that are intended to partially replace your employment income for as long as your disability regularly prevents you from working.\nWhen you reach 65 years old, your disability benefit will automatically be changed to a CPP retirement pension.\nIf you are receiving the CPP post-retirement disability benefit, it will stop when you reach age 65, and you will continue to receive only your CPP retirement pension.\nThe CPP retirement pension will likely be less than your disability benefit. However, you may then qualify for the Old Age Security (OAS) pension and the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS).\nWhen CPP disability benefits stop, any related disabled contributor\u2019s child\u2019s benefits also stop.\n5.0 Important information\nIn this section\nYour responsibilities\nParticipating in work, school or volunteer activities\nTax considerations\nIn case of death\nReassessment of eligibility\nOverpayments\nYour responsibilities\nYou need to tell Service Canada when:\nyou have earned $6,600 (before tax) in 2023 and you should call when you return to work (including self-employment)\nyou are attending school and/or volunteering for 15 hours or more per week for 4 months or more\nyour medical condition improves enough that you may be able to return to work\nyour mailing address, telephone number, or bank account used for direct deposit changes, and/or\nyour custody and control of dependent children starts or ends (including by birth, adoption, marriage, common-law relationship, or death)\nReporting a return to work, school, or volunteer activities does not necessarily mean your benefits will stop. Instead, it is an opportunity for Service Canada to support you with information about our work-related supports and services.\nParticipating in work, school or volunteer activities\nVolunteering or going to school while receiving CPP disability benefits\nService Canada recognizes the importance of volunteer work, education, and training. Many of our clients can participate in volunteer work and education/training, and they continue to receive their disability benefits. However, sometimes this can signal your ability to work and can impact whether you still qualify to receive disability benefits.\nWhen you are volunteering (in-person or online) or going to school (in-person or online) you must contact Service Canada if:\nyou are doing any combination of these activities for 15 hours a week or more, and\nyou have been doing these activities on a regular basis for 4 continuous months or longer\nYou must also tell Service Canada if you successfully complete a school, university, college, trade, technical training, or rehabilitation program.\nWorking and earning money while receiving CPP disability benefits\nYou must contact Service Canada when you begin working, and once you have earned $6,600 (before tax) in 2023. Your disability benefits may be impacted by your gross (before tax) earnings.\nIf you earn below $6,600 (before tax), this alone should not affect your disability benefits\nIf you earn between $6,600 and $18,508.36 (before tax), this may show that you are regularly capable of working and it may affect your disability benefits\nIf you earn $18,508.36 (before tax) or more, this demonstrates you are regularly capable of working and you will likely no longer qualify for disability benefits\nIf you delay in contacting us when you start making over the allowed amount, you might have to pay some money back.\nSelf-employment while receiving CPP disability benefits\nThe same rules apply when you are self-employed. You need to contact Service Canada once you reach $6,600 in gross business earnings (before tax) and you should call as soon as you begin working. Service Canada will review your file and look at a number of factors to determine if you still qualify for disability benefits. These factors include how involved you are in the everyday activities of the business, and the gross earnings of the business.\nIf your disability reoccurs within 2 years\nIf you are no longer able to continue working, volunteering or attending school because of the same or related disability, your disability benefits can be quickly reinstated. This means you can ask to have your benefits started again without having to go through the usual application process. You may qualify for automatic reinstatement if:\nyou notified Service Canada about your return to work, volunteer, and/or school attendance before your benefits stopped\nyou stopped receiving disability benefits because you returned to work, volunteered, and/or attended school\nyour benefit stopped within the last 2 years\nyour same or related disability reoccurred within 2 years, and\nyou contacted Service Canada within 1 year of stopping work, volunteering, and/or school attendance\nyou met the earnings and contributions requirements\nIf your children are still eligible, their disabled contributor's children's benefit will also be reinstated.\n*Some restrictions apply to reinstate the CPP post-retirement disability benefit. Contact Service Canada for details.\nIf your disability reoccurs within 5 years\nYou may qualify for a fast-track reapplication if:\nyou stopped receiving disability benefits because you have returned to work\nyour benefits stopped within the last 5 years\nyour same or related disability reoccurred within 5 years\nyou contacted Service Canada within 1 year of stopping work, and\nyou met the earnings and contributions requirements\nIf your children are still eligible, their disabled contributor's children's benefit will also be reinstated.\nVocational Rehabilitation Program for recipients of Canada Pension Plan disability benefits\nThe Vocational Rehabilitation Program is a voluntary program that helps suitable CPP disability beneficiaries return to work. If you are thinking of returning to work, a variety of services such as guidance, training, and job placement may be available.\nWhile you participate in the program, you continue to receive your regular CPP disability benefits, including while you search for a job.\nTo participate in this program, contact Service Canada.\nThree-month work trial while receiving CPP disability benefits\nIf you return to work on a regular basis, you may be able to continue to receive your disability benefits for 3 months. This gives you and Service Canada time to evaluate your ability to work regularly.\nIf you are still capable of working after 3 months, your CPP disability benefits will likely stop.\nTax considerations\nDisability Tax Credit (DTC)\nYou may be eligible for the Disability Tax Credit administered by the Canada Revenue Agency, which could reduce the amount of income tax you may have to pay.\nTo apply, you must:\ncomplete Part A of the Disability Tax Credit Certificate (T2201)\nask a medical practitioner to complete Part B and certify that you have a severe and prolonged impairment and describe the effects of this impairment\nonce the Disability Tax Credit Certificate (T2201) is complete, send the form to the Disability Tax Credit Union at Canada Revenue Agency, and\nmail the form to the address indicated on the last page of the Certificate\nWorking Income Tax Benefit (WITB)\nThe Working Income Tax Benefit (WITB) is a refundable tax credit that provides tax relief for eligible low-income individuals and families who have employment or business income.\nIf you qualify for both the DTC and the WITB, you may qualify to claim the WITB Disability Supplement. For more information, visit Canada.ca/taxes or call the CRA at 1-800-959-8281. For TTY service, call 1-800-665-0354.\nNote\nService Canada\u2019s definition of disability is different from the definition used by the Canada Revenue Agency.\nIn case of death\nWhat if I die before starting to receive CPP disability benefits?\nIf you signed a Canada Pension Plan Disability Benefits Application (ISP1151) and Service Canada receives it before your death, we will continue to process your application. If it is approved, any money payable up to the date of death will be sent to your estate.\nIf you signed your application for a disability benefit and Service Canada receives it after you die, your application must be denied.\nIn either case, your estate may be eligible to receive the CPP death benefit. Your survivors may be eligible for the CPP survivor's pension and surviving children's benefit.\nReassessment of eligibility\nFrom time to time, cases are reviewed to ensure that only eligible people receive disability benefits.\nIf your case is being reviewed, you may be asked to provide current medical and other information. Because everyone's medical condition and capacity to work is unique, each case is looked at individually.\nOnce all the necessary information has been collected, a decision to continue or stop disability benefits is made. We will inform you of this decision in writing.\nOverpayments\nIf you receive payments to which you are not entitled, you will have to pay them back.\n6.0 Glossary and resources\nIn this section\nGlossary of terms\nLinks to other resources\nGlossary of terms\nNote\nIn case of conflict between the interpretation of terminology in this toolkit and the terminology of the Canada Pension Plan and Regulations, the terminology of the Plan and Regulations prevail.\nAllowable earnings\nThe maximum amount that a CPP disability beneficiary can earn in a calendar year without notifying Service Canada.

At age 45 Jamie went back to work. He contributed to the CPP for 3 years before having to stop work due to a terminal illness. Jamie has contributed to the CPP for at least 25 years, with contributions in 3 of the last 6 years.\nOutcome\nJamie is eligible for the CPP disability pension.\n3. Late applicant provision\nWho\nWayan had to stop working several years ago because of a severe and prolonged medical condition (according to CPP legislation).

However, since March 2017, Canada has an international social security agreement with Peru.\nOutcome\nPaz can be considered for CPP disability benefits. By combining his years of contributions to the Peruvian social security system with those to the Canada Pension Plan, Paz will meet the requirement for contributions in 4 of the last 6 years. The amount that Paz receives will be based only on his CPP contributions. Paz should consider applying for a disability pension from Peru as well.\n6. Child-rearing provision\nWho\nChris recently stopped working because of a severe and prolonged medical condition.\nScenario\nHe had previously been out of the workforce to look after his daughter since she was born 6 years ago.

However, there is continuing contact between Morgan and Madison. Morgan gave consent to Service Canada to contact and tell Marley, the other parent, that Madison is entitled to the disabled contributor's children's benefit.\nOutcome\nBecause there is continuing contact between Morgan and Madison, Morgan must complete the Application for Benefits for under Age 18 Children of Disabled Contributor (ISP1152) to receive the benefit on Madison's behalf.\n3.

These activities can include studying, researching, writing papers, completing assignments and more.\nYou must also notify Service Canada if you complete a school, university, trade, technical training or rehabilitation program.\nService Canada recognizes the importance of volunteer work, education and training. Many of our beneficiaries can participate in volunteer work and education/training and continue to receive their CPP disability benefits.\nHowever, in some cases this could signal your ability to work and could impact whether you still qualify to receive CPP disability benefits.\nExamples\nVolunteering over 15 hours a week for more than 4 months\nJohn has been receiving CPP disability pension since November 2015. John has started volunteering as a cashier at a cafeteria and selling clothing. He volunteers 5 days a week, for 5 hours a day since January 2019. His duties include pricing, handling money, cooking and cleaning.\nJohn needs to report this activity to Service Canada. John's benefits may be impacted if it is determined his activity demonstrates work capacity.\nCombination of volunteering and educational activity totaling over 15 hours a week for more than 4 months\nMichael has been receiving CPP disability pension since 2015. Six months ago, he started providing free business advice to the business community. He offers his services online for 3 to 4 hours a day, 5 days a week. Sometimes Michael takes mini virtual courses to improve his service offerings.\nMichael needs to report this activity to Service Canada. Michael's benefits may be impacted if it is determined his activities are demonstrating work capacity.\nVolunteering under 15 hours a week for more than 4 months\nMargo has been receiving CPP disability pension since June of 2019. Since then, she sometimes volunteers at a community centre nearby. Her duties included, shredding old documents, photocopying pamphlets and putting them out for display. She spends anywhere from 5 to 10 hours per week at the centre, on a drop in basis whenever she can.\nMargo does not need to report this activity to Service Canada. Although she has participated in volunteer activity for over 4 months, the activity is under the reporting threshold of 15 hours per week.\nWorking and earning money\nYou must contact Service Canada when you begin working, and once you have earned $6,600 (before tax) in 2023 . Your disability benefits may be impacted by your gross (before tax) earnings:\nif you earn below $6,600 (before tax), this alone should not affect your disability benefits\nif you earn between $6,600 and $18,508.36 (before tax), this may show that you are regularly capable of working and it may affect your disability benefits\nif you earn $18,508.36 (before tax) or more, this demonstrates you are regularly capable of working and you will likely no longer qualify for disability benefits\nIf you delay in contacting us when you start making over the allowed amount, you might have to pay some money back.\nVocational rehabilitation program\nIf you are thinking of returning to work, a variety of services such as guidance, training, and job placement may be available.\nLearn more about the vocational rehabilitation program\nThree-month work trial\nIf you return to work on a regular basis, you may be able to continue to receive your disability benefits for 3 months. This gives you and the CPP time to evaluate your ability to work regularly.\nIf you are still capable of working after 3 months, your CPP disability benefits will likely stop.\nRe-starting disability benefits for the same disability\nIf you are no longer able to work after your benefits stop, you may qualify for Automatic Reinstatement or the Fast Track Re-application process. These are designed to get you back into pay as quickly as possible when you are unable to continue working due to a reoccurrence of the same or related disability.\nThis is also true if your benefit stopped because of your self reported volunteer and/or educational activities.\nExamples\nReporting a Return to Work\nTara plans to return to work. Tara's benefits can continue while she tries working. She must contact Service Canada once she earns $6,400 (before tax), at which time she is eligible for a 3-month work trial. This provides Tara and Service Canada time to evaluate her ability to work on a regular basis. If Tara is still working after the end of the work trial, this may show that she is regularly capable of working and it may affect her disability benefits.\nNot Reporting a Return to Work\nRobert returned to the workforce, but did not contact Service Canada. He is no longer able to do his job as a roofer but his company offered him light work as an estimator. He returned to work in March working 30 hours a week. Since Robert did not report his return to work, he may no longer be eligible for the CPP disability benefit and may be required to pay back benefits to which he was not entitled to receive.\nSelf-Employment\nCynthia started her own company. She designs and sells clothing when she feels well enough. Cynthia has the same responsibilities as other beneficiaries who return to work and must contact Service Canada once she earns $6,400 (before tax). The gross business earnings of Cynthia's business and her involvement in the day-to-day business will be considered in the review of her file.\nWork Trial\nAmina contacted Service Canada to report that she had returned to work. Amina was provided a three-month work trial to test her ability to work. At the end of the three-month work trial, Amina had earned $7,200, despite missing many days of work due to her medical condition. She was unable to continue working due to her medical condition. Service Canada determined that Amina's condition remained severe and prolonged and she remained eligible to receive CPP disability benefits.\nAutomatic Reinstatement\nRaj contacted Service Canada when he returned to work. His benefits were stopped after a successful 3-month work trial. Less than 2 years later, his disability worsened and he could no longer continue working. Since Raj had reported his return to work and his disability reoccurred within 2 years, he was eligible for the automatic reinstatement of this benefits. This means that his benefits could be reinstated without having to go through the usual application process.\nWhen your benefit could stop\nThe disability benefit is meant to replace some of your employment income for as long as your disability stops you from working at any job on a regular basis.\nYour disability benefit will stop if you:\nyou are capable of working on a regular basis\nyou are no longer disabled\nyou turn 65\nyou die\nWhen a disability benefit is cancelled, any related children's benefits are also cancelled.\nWhen you turn 65\nWhen you turn 65 the disability benefit will automatically be changed to a Canada Pension Plan retirement pension. If you are getting the post-retirement disability benefit, it will stop.\nYour retirement pension will be less than your disability benefit. However, you can also apply for Old Age Security and the Guaranteed Income Supplement. Your spouse or common-law partner may also be eligible for the Allowance benefit if they are 60 to 64 (up to and including the month of their 65th birthday).\nWhen someone dies\nIf you're reading this following the loss of a loved one, please accept our condolences.\nWhen someone dies, please inform us as soon as possible to avoid overpayment.
